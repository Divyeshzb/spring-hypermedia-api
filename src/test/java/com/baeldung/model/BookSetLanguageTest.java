================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation CWE-20
Issue: Assuming that the input to methods will be correctly formatted or benign can be risky, leading to vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection, depending on the context in which the method input is used.
Solution: Perform proper input validation or sanitization. In the case of data that is used for SQL queries, consider use of prepared statements or parameterized queries. For data that will be output in HTML, consider HTML escaping to avoid XSS attacks.

Vulnerability: Sensitive data exposure CWE-200
Issue: The property 'language' is directly exposed to the outer world without any check. If any sensitive information is stored into 'language', that can cause a security risk.
Solution: Rather than directly exposing the components, always use getters and setters, and inside these, put necessary checks. When you are setting sensitive data, make sure to use proper security mechanisms while storing.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) CWE-639
Issue: If an authenticated user can change the 'value' of parameter to any other value and get/alter the data of another user, this leads to Insecure Direct Object References.
Solution: Perform access controls checks, and/or ensure that you are using 'horizontally' scalable data stores so that you separate out where the data is being stored, to prevent users from being able to alter/access each other's data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to Check if the Language is Set Correctly

Details:  
TestName: testLanguageIsSetCorrectly.
Description: This test checks whether the string entered is correctly set as the language. 
Execution:
Arrange: Establish a new object or instance for testing and an expected language string.
Act: Invoke the setLanguage method, passing the expected language string as input.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual language set in the object with the expected language.
Validation: 
The assertion aims to confirm whether the entered language was set correctly. The expected result is based on the input string provided during the execution phase. It is significant for ensuring that the method behaves as expected by correctly assigning the input string to the language variable.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Language

Details:  
TestName: testForNullLanguage.
Description: This test targets the scenario where the input language string is null.
Execution:
Arrange: Establish a new object or instance for testing and assign null as the expected language.
Act: Invoke the setLanguage method, passing null as input.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to determine whether the actual language set in the object is null.
Validation: 
This test aims to ensure that the method appropriately handles null inputs by assigning null to the language variable. The expected result is null, given the input provided during the execution phase. The test is essential for confirming that the method doesn't cause unwarranted errors when handling null inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with Empty Language String

Details:  
TestName: testWithEmptyLanguageString.
Description: The test checks how the setLanguage method responds to an empty string input.
Execution:
Arrange: Establish a new object or instance for testing and assign an empty string as the expected language.
Act: Invoke the setLanguage method, passing the empty string as input.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual language in the object with the expected (empty) language.
Validation: 
This test validates that the method handles empty string inputs without errors by assigning the empty string to the language variable. The expected result is an empty string, given the input provided during the execution phase. This test is crucial in ensuring that the method can manage potentially problematic input scenarios.
