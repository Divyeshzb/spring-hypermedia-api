================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insufficient Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The `setLanguage` method directly assigns the value of its parameter to the `language` field. If the user-provided data is not validated, it might cause problems, such as code injection or related security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Employ input validation strategies such as whitelisting to control what is allowed as a `language` value.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-89)
Issue: If the `language` field is used in a SQL query and is not properly neutralized, it may lead to SQL Injection attack.
Solution: Used Prepared Statements or Parameterized Queries to mitigate the risk of SQL injection. Avoid building SQL queries using string concatenation with raw user input.

Vulnerability: Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
Issue: The `language` field might be sensitive and should not be exposed to all types of users. Inappropriate exposure could lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
Solution: Implement appropriate access controls, maybe by using annotations such as `@JsonIgnore` or `@JsonView`, to manage visibility of the `language` field.

"""
Scenario 1: Setting language with valid text input

Details:  
  TestName: setLanguageWithValidInput.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the method setLanguage accepts a valid string and sets the variable 'language' properly. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string with a valid language name.
  Act: Invoke the setLanguage method passing the created language string as argument.
  Assert: Use JUnit assert method to see if the instance's 'language' field gets the same value as the passed argument.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to confirm that the 'language' field of the instance gets the value provided by the setLanguage method.
  This test ensures that the method operates correctly under normal conditions and improves the reliability and quality of the code.


Scenario 2: Setting language with null input

Details: 
  TestName: setLanguageWithNullInput.
  Description: This test is intended to check how the setLanguage method handles null value. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null string.
  Act: Invoke the setLanguage method passing the null string as an argument.
  Assert: Use JUnit assert method to check if the instance's 'language' field is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to confirm that the 'language' field of the instance is set as null when a null string is passed to the setLanguage method.
  This test ensures that the method can appropriately handle null values, preventing potential NullPointerExceptions and ensuring the stability of the application.


Scenario 3: Setting language with empty string

Details: 
  TestName: setLanguageWithEmptyString.
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the setLanguage method handles an empty string argument. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the setLanguage method passing the empty string as an argument.
  Assert: Use JUnit assert method to check if the instance's 'language' field is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'language' field of the instance is set as an empty string when an empty string is passed to the setLanguage method.
  This test ensures that the method can appropriately handle empty sort of inputs that could be considered as invalid or unusual conditions.
