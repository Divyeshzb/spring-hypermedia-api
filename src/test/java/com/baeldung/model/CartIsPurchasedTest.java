================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The variable 'purchased' might be directly exposed to the user interface. This can allow malicious users to reference these direct object references to gain unauthorized access to data.
Solution: Ensure to implement proper access control checks like retrieving the data via an intermediate method that can ensure the user has the correct permissions to perform the operation.

Vulnerability: Insecure data handling or CWE-20
Issue: If 'purchased' variable holds sensitive data it could be a potential risk exposing sensitive data to attackers.
Solution: Remove sensitive data from your logs, exceptions, and UI. Always encrypt sensitive data, even when stored or in transit. Validate, filter or sanitize all incoming data.

Vulnerability: Misuse of third-party libraries or CWE-1173
Issue: If third-party libraries (like ArrayList or List from java.util) are used inappropriately or if they have their own vulnerabilities, it can expose your application to various security risks.
Solution: Always use the latest version of third-party libraries which usually come with security fixes. Use only what you need from a library, reduce your attack surface. Be aware of the security risks associated with the library functions you are using.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test the method with purchased as true

Details:  
  TestName: testIsPurchasedAsTrue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the isPurchased() method correctly returns true if the 'purchased' variable is set to true. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the 'purchased' variable to true.
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if the return value is true.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify if the isPurchased() method correctly identifies when the 'purchased' variable is true. The expected result is that it should return true. This is significant as it confirms that the method is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test the method with purchased as false

Details:  
  TestName: testIsPurchasedAsFalse
  Description: This test is meant to check if the isPurchased() method correctly returns false if the 'purchased' variable is set to false.  
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the 'purchased' variable to false.
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if the return value is false.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify if the isPurchased() method correctly identifies when the 'purchased' variable is false. The expected result is that it should return false. This is significant as it confirms that the method is working as expected.

Scenario 3: Test for default value of purchased

Details:  
  TestName: testDefaultValueOfPurchased
  Description: This test is meant to check the isPurchased() method for its default value. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set the 'purchased' variable manually, let it hold its default value.
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if the return value is false.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the default value of 'purchased'. In Java, the default value of a boolean variable is false. So, if we don't set 'purchased' manually should return false. This is significant because the default value is a common case.
