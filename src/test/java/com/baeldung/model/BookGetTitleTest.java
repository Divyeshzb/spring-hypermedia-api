ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getTitle_d9ed830539

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: In case the 'getId' method (not present in the given code) uses a Predictable Random Value as this can lead to vulnerabilities if used in security-sensitive context.
Solution: Use SecureRandom instead of the Random class in java.util package for security-sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: If sensitive information is exposed in the JSON response triggered by the 'getTitle' method, it could be a potential data leak.
Solution: Heavily utilise the JsonIgnore and JsonView annotations to control what data gets serialized to the client-side. Take particular care to ensure no sensitive fields are unintentionally serialized.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: Potential SQL Injection if the get methods are based on String concatenation to create SQL queries.
Solution: To avoid SQL Injection vulnerabilities, use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of building SQL queries through string concatenation.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: Default entity permissions can sometimes lead to unauthorized data access.
Solution: Ensure that the security constraints are properly set and access to data is role-based, allowing only authorized access to sensitive data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to Validate Title Is Returned Correctly 

Details:  
  TestName: testTitleIsReturned 
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getTitle function returns the correct title string that was assigned to this class instance. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a class instance with the assigned title.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the class instance.
  Assert: Assert that the title returned from getTitle equals to assigned title.
Validation: 
  This test aims to validate that the correct title is returned by the getTitle method. The expected result is that the returned title will match the title that was assigned. The test's significance is to ensure that the getTitle function works correctly and retrieves the correct data.

Scenario 2: Empty Title Test 

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyTitle 
  Description: This test checks if the getTitle function can handle and return an empty string as the title.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a class instance with an empty string as the title.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the class instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned title from getTitle is an empty string.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that an empty string can be handled correctly by the getTitle method. The expected result is that the returned title will be an empty string. This test is significant as it checks the function's ability to handle edge cases properly.

Scenario 3: Null Title Test

Details:
  TestName: testNullTitle
  Description: This test checks if the getTitle function can handle and return null as the title.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a class instance with null as the title.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the class instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned title from getTitle is null.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that null can be handled correctly by the getTitle method. The expected result is that the returned title will be null. This test is significant as it checks the function's ability to handle null values.

Scenario 4: Long String Title Test 

Details:
  TestName: testLongStringTitle
  Description: This test checks if the getTitle function can handle and return extremely long strings appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a class instance with a very long string as the title.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the class instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned title from getTitle is the same very long string.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getTitle function can handle long string return values. The expected result is that the returned title will be the same very long string. This test is significant as it checks the function's ability to handle edge cases properly.
