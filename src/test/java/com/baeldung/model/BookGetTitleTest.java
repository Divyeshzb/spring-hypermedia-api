================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution. Even if deserialization flaws do not result in remote code execution, serialized objects can be replayed, or their properties could be manipulated to perform other attacks.
Solution: Use the Safe Deserialization Pattern with a whitelist of classes, or use Java's SerializableProxy pattern. Be cautious of any deserialization inputs

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If the application allows user-input values to control or influence database query construct without proper neutralization, it could cause SQL injection which is a high risk security vulnerability.
Solution: Do not concatenate user-input values directly into SQL query construct. Use parameterized queries or ORM strategies.

  Scenario 1: Test the return value of the getTitle method

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetTitleReturnValue
    Description: The test is meant to check if the getTitle method returns the correct value. The target scenario includes the case of invoking this method without setting any value to the title.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no required data, mocks, or test doubles needing setup. 
    Act: The getTitle method is invoked without any parameters. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual return value against NULL or empty string (the initial value of the title).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getTitle method correctly returns the initial value of title when it has not been set. This test is significant as it checks the basic getter functionality to ensure it returns correct value.

  
  Scenario 2: Test getTitle method after setting title

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetTitleAfterSettingValue
    Description: The test is meant to check if the getTitle method can return the correct value after the title is set. The target scenario includes invoking getTitle method after a value is assigned to the title.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a particular string to the title. 
    Act: The getTitle method is invoked without any parameters. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual return value against the assigned value to the title.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getTitle method correctly returns the current value of the title after it has been set. This test is essential to check if getter method is retrieving the stored value accurately in normal operation scenarios.
    

  Scenario 3: Test getTitle method with multiple invocations after setting title

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetTitleAfterMultipleInvocations
    Description: The test is meant to check if multiple invocations of getTitle method retain the correct value. Main scenario is to check if returning title does not mutate the state.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a particular string to the title. 
    Act: The getTitle method is invoked multiple times. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual return value against assigned value to title for all invocations.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getTitle method correctly returns the current value of title even after multiple invocations. This test is important to ensure that getter method does not mutate the state and retains the consistent output.
