================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
Issue: If the application exposes a getter for a mutable field without any corresponding setter, a malicious user might exploit this to potentially alter the state of the object in unforeseen ways.
Solution: To mitigate this, ensure proper control over access and modification to object attributes. Best to expose only necessary object attributes with your getters and setters.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: If any entity field marked with @JsonIgnore is exposed via Getter/Setter it will lead to information exposure. Tests should be written to ensure that the @JsonIgnore annotation is used properly.
Solution: Add @JsonIgnore to the information, which should not be exposed in the JSON.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: In case if the data input from this model is directly used in SQL queries, it might lead to SQL injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized.
Solution: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries while dealing with SQL to prevent SQL injections.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test getTitle returns the correct value
Details:  
  TestName: getTitleReturnsCorrectValue.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the `getTitle` method correctly returns the title value for the Entity that it is invoked on.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an object of the Entity class with a known title. 
  Act: Invoke the `getTitle` method on the object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned title against the known title.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies whether the title returned by the getTitle method is as expected, ensuring that the getter method works properly. This test is important for maintaining the integrity of the encapsulated title data in the Entity object.

Scenario 2: Test getTitle on a new default instance of the Entity
Details:  
  TestName: getTitleOnDefaultInstance.
  Description: This test is meant to see what happens when the `getTitle` method is invoked on a new instance of the Entity that doesn't specifically set a title. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a default instance of the Entity class. 
  Act: Invoke the `getTitle` method on this default instance. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that null or the default title value is returned.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that invoking the getTitle method on a default instance of the Entity class behaves as expected. It shows what to expect when dealing with new instances of the Entity class, which is important to know when developing and debugging the application.

Scenario 3: Test getTitle with null title
Details:  
  TestName: getTitleWithNullValue.
  Description: This test aims to see what happens when the `getTitle` method is invoked on an instance of the Entity where the title is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an instance of the Entity class with title set as null. 
  Act: Invoke the `getTitle` method on this object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that null is returned.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getTitle method can handle cases where the title is null, and doesn't cause any unexpected errors or side effects. Handling of null values is a common potential source of bugs, so it's important to validate this functionality.
