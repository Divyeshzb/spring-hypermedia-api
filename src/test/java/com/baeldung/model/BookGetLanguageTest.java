ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getLanguage_a2c4f9fde3
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getLanguage_8fdd2e241f

Scenario 1: Test to validate if getLanguage() returns correct language. 

Details:  
  TestName: testIsCorrectLanguageReturned
  Description: This test is meant to check if the "getLanguage()" method returns the correct value as set for "language". If the language of the application has been set to a specific value, this method must return that exact same value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the "language" property.
  Act: Invoke the "getLanguage()" method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the value set for "language".
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the "getLanguage()" method accurately returns the value set for "language". It is significant in ensuring the application has the correct language setting. 

Scenario 2: Test for null value scenario.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageForNullValue
  Description: This test is meant to ensure the method can handle null values. If no specific language has been set or the "language" is null, the method should handle this gracefully. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the "language" or explicitly set "language" as null.
  Act: Invoke the "getLanguage()" method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null or not.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to validate that "getLanguage()" handles null values well. This test is important from the error handling perspective ensuring that the method can handle all situations.

Scenario 3: Test for empty string scenario.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageForEmptyString
  Description: This test is designed to check how the method handles an empty string when it tries to get the language. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the "language" as an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the "getLanguage()" method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation: 
  This test will verify whether "getLanguage()" returns an empty string when "language" is set as such. The significance of this test is to make sure the method handles empty strings correctly by returning the same.
