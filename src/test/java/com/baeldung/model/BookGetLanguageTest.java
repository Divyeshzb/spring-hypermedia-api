================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: If user input is directly used in SQL queries without correctly escaping or using prepared statements, SQL Injections can occur.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks in conjunction with proper input validation and sanitization.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR, CWE-932)
Issue: If object references directly expose to user input without sufficient access control checks, it can allow unauthorized access to data.
Solution: Provide appropriate access controls to ensure that every user can only access the data they're authorized for, and verify object ownership or access permissions before acting on user requests.

Vulnerability: Exposed sensitive data in JSON (CWE-200)
Issue: If sensitive data (e.g., password hashes, encryption keys) get exposed via the JSON responses without appropriate measures, it could be exploited by malicious actors.
Solution: Make sure that only necessary data is shared via JSON responses. Use the @JsonIgnore annotation to exclude sensitive fields from the JSON output.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Positive Test Case - Language attribute is non-null and non-empty 

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageHasValidValue
  Description: This test aims to confirm that when getLanguage is invoked, it will return the correct value that is already set for language attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a known value for the language attribute beforehand.
  Act: Call the getLanguage method.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the value set for the language attribute.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the returned value matches the one set for the language attribute. This test validates that the getLanguage method properly retrieves the value of the language attribute.

Scenario 2: Negative Test Case - Language attribute is null 

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageIsNull
  Description: This test is to ensure that getLanguage method handles null value properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set any value for the language attribute, keeping it as null.
  Act: Invoke getLanguage method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the return value is null as expected. It confirms if the getLanguage function can handle null values correctly.

Scenario 3: Negative Test Case - Language attribute is an empty string

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageIsEmptyString
  Description: This test is meant to confirm that getLanguage handles empty strings correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an empty string for the language attribute.
  Act: Invoke the getLanguage method.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the return value from getLanguage is an empty string as expected. This test validates that the getLanguage function behaves as expected when the language attribute is set to an empty string.
