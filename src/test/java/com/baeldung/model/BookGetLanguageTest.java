================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Inadequate protection with Hibernate framework (CWE-532)
Issue: Hard-coded data like 'language'. Hard-coded data may not have protection from alteration in code, which could be exploited by an attacker to alter the logic of the code indirectly.
Solution: Replace hard-coded data with variable parameters using Hibernate framework's protection mechanisms, such as @Column( columnDefinition='VARCHAR(50) default "English"' )

Vulnerability: Missing Entity Annotation (CWE-358)
Issue: This chunk of code is likely meant to be a part of an Entity class in a Java Persistence API (JPA) context, but it's missing @Entity annotation. If the developer forgets to put this annotation on a class, instances of that class won't be persisted to the database.
Solution: Ensure all Entity classes in the JPA context have correct @Entity annotation.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209)
Issue: Encountering an error in this code may result in displaying unnecessary information as there's no error handling structure.
Solution: Implement a global exception handling methodology. Typically, we can use @ControllerAdvice for this. Additionally, avoid exposing detailed and sensitive information through error messages.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the response of getLanguage method in a normal or ideal case.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageNormalCase
  Description: This test case is meant to assert that the getLanguage method returns the correct language string in a normal or standard scenario. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a class containing getLanguage method. Set the "language" property with a known value.  
  Act: Invoke the getLanguage method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the actual output of the getLanguage method matches the language string set before.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getLanguage method correctly returns the language string set earlier.
  This test helps to ensure the correctness of essential application behavior that involves retrieving the language string.

Scenario 2: Test to confirm the behavior of getLanguage method when the language is not set (null).

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageWhenLanguageIsNull
  Description: In this scenario, the getLanguage method is tested when the language string has not been set or is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a class containing getLanguage method without setting the "language" property.  
  Act: Invoke the getLanguage method. 
  Assert: Assert that the output of the getLanguage method is null using JUnit assertions.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates the behavior of getLanguage when the language string has not been set.
  This test is crucial to validate application functionality in terms of error handling when language has not been set in the system.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the behavior of getLanguage method when the language is an empty string.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageWhenLanguageIsEmpty
  Description: This scenario tests the behavior of the getLanguage method when the language string is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a class containing getLanguage method and set the "language" property as an empty string.  
  Act: Invoke the getLanguage method. 
  Assert: Assert that the output of the getLanguage method is an empty string using JUnit assertions.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies the behavior of the getLanguage method when the language string is an empty string.
  This test is crucial in validating the application's behavior in scenarios where the language is set as an empty string.
