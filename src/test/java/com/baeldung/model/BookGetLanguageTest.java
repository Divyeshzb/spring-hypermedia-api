Scenario 1: Testing if Method getLanguage Returns Expected Language Value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageMethodReturnsExpectedResult
  Description: This test will check whether the getLanguage method returns the expected language value that was previously set. The target scenario is the normal operation of the method, returning the correct value.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed, as no preprocessing necessary before invoking getLanguage.
  Act: Call the getLanguage method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned language equals the expected value.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getLanguage method correctly returns the language attribute of the object. The assertion seeks to confirm normal operation of this method. The relevance of this test lies in its ability to affirm that any representation of a language is returned correctly. 

Scenario 2: Testing if Method getLanguage Returns Null

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageMethodReturnsNull
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getLanguage method returns null when the language attribute has not been initialized. The target scenario is when no language value has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed, nothing to initialize before test.
  Act: Call the getLanguage method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned language equals null.
Validation: 
  This tests if the getLanguage method correctly handles a situation where the language value is not set up. The assertion validates that the method returns null when language is not initialized or assigned. This is crucial for correctly understanding the object's state when the language hasn't been set.

Scenario 3: Testing if Method getLanguage Handles Concurrent Calls

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageHandlesConcurrentCalls
  Description: Test that getLanguage method correctly handles multiple simultaneous calls. The method should return the correct value, regardless of how many threads are accessing it concurrently.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up multiple threads to call the method simultaneously.
  Act: Simultaneously call the getLanguage method from each thread.
  Assert: Assert that each thread gets the correct language value.
Validation: 
  This test helps to ensure that the method is thread-safe and can correctly handle concurrent calls. The assertion validates that the method maintains state integrity even under load. It is crucial to ensure that multiple threads interacting with these objects do not interfere with each other's operations.
