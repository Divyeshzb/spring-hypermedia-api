================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: In general, if user-provided data is incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL codes to manipulate the database, potentially leading to data loss, data leakage, or unauthorized data modification.
Solution: Ensure that all inputs are sanitized before they are used in SQL queries. Use frameworks that automatically escape SQL parameters to prevent SQL injection (like Hibernate).

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), sometimes known as 'Forced Browsing'
Issue: If user can control the input which is directly used to fetch data from the database, then an attacker can manipulate this input to access unauthorized data.
Solution: Avoid exposing direct database identifiers. Make sure access controls are in place to verify the user has access to the requested data.

Vulnerability: Data Leakage (CWE-200)
Issue: If the complete entity is returned in the response of API calls, there maybe sensitive fields which should not be exposed. As seen in the imports, it seems the class has a JsonIgnore annotation which can be used to ignore fields.
Solution: Sensitive fields must be marked with '@JsonIgnore' to prevent them from being sent in the API response. Also, consider using DTO(Data Transfer Object) instead of directly using Entity in the response.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify the creation of a regular book instance

  Details:  
    TestName: testRegularBookCreation
    Description: The test is intended to verify that a new Book instance can be created with 'author', 'title' and 'isbn' parameters provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate variables for 'author', 'title' and 'isbn'. 
    Act: Invoke the 'Book' constructor with the given variables.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm the new Book instance is created and the correct values are assigned to the respective fields. 
  Validation: 
    The test asserts that a new Book can be instantiated successfully, and the provided parameters are correctly assigned to the respective fields. The success of this test assures that regular object creation functionality is working as expected. 


  Scenario 2: Test to verify the book instance creation with null input in parameter fields

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullInputBookCreation
    Description: This test is meant to check that the Book constructor can handle null inputs without throwing unwanted exceptions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate variables for 'author', 'title', and 'isbn' as null. 
    Act: Invoke the 'Book' constructor with these variables.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that a new Book instance is created. 
  Validation: 
    The test is designed to check the null handling mechanism in the constructor. If the test passes, we can be sure that the constructor safely handles null inputs.


  Scenario 3: Test to verify the book instance creation with empty String as input in parameter fields

  Details:
    TestName: testEmptyStringInputBookCreation
    Description: It's meant to check that a Book instance can be created with empty Strings as parameters without throwing any exceptions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate variables for 'author', 'title', and 'isbn' as empty Strings. 
    Act: Invoke the 'Book' constructor with these variables.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that a new Book instance is created successfully.
  Validation: 
    The test is designed to check how the constructor handles empty string inputs. The passing of this test ensures that the constructor can handle empty strings with no exceptions.
  

  Scenario 4: Test to verify book instance creation with long String input that exceeds database column size

  Details: 
    TestName: testExcessiveLengthStringInputBookCreation
    Description: The test is meant to verify how the constructor handles unusually long input Strings that exceed the capacity of the corresponding entity's database columns.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate variables 'author', 'title', and 'isbn' with Strings that exceed the column size. 
    Act: Invoke the 'Book' constructor with these variables.
    Assert: As there is no database involvement at this level, a new Book instance is expected to get created with exceedingly long parameters. 
  Validation: 
    This test aims to ensure the constructor can handle extremely long Strings without crashing or causing any errors at the object creation level. The ability to handle this scenario effectively shows the robustness of the Book class' basic functionality.
