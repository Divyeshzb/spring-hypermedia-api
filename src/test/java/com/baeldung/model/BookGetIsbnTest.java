================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: This vulnerability could occur if the application uses input in database queries without proper sanitization, leading to potential unauthorized data access or manipulation.
Solution: Code should be updated to use prepared statements, parameterized queries or sanitize input before including in database queries.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)
Issue: If the application uses user input in HTML output without proper encoding, it could be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
Solution: Use context appropriate output encoding libraries to ensure user input is safely included in HTML output.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If access control checks are not properly implemented, an authenticated user may be able to manipulate references to access unauthorized data.
Solution: Ensure that access control checks are conducted correctly at all points where user-controlled data is used to access objects directly.

================================================================================
Here, we are testing a simple getter method called "getIsbn". 
Since there is no argument, the only thing we are testing here is whether it returns the correct value that was stored.

Scenario 1: Testing the getIsbn method for valid Isbn

Details:
  TestName: getIsbnWithValidInput
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getIsbn method when a valid ISBN is used.
Execution:
    Arrange: We need to set up a valid string `isbn` that needs to be returned by the method.
    Act: Invoke the getIsbn method.
    Assert: The expected output should match the string `isbn` that we set before.
Validation:
    The assertion will aim to verify the existence and correctness of the ISBN. If the `getIsbn` method functions correctly, it's expected to return the exact string we assigned to `isbn`.

Scenario 2: Testing the getIsbn method for null Isbn

Details:
  TestName: getIsbnWithNullInput
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getIsbn method when ISBN is null.
Execution:
    Arrange: We need to set `isbn` null before invoking the getIsbn method.
    Act: Invoke the getIsbn method.
    Assert: The expected output should be null.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the `getIsbn` method handles null inputs properly and returns null as expected rather than throwing an exception or error.

Scenario 3: Testing the getIsbn method for empty Isbn

Details:
  TestName: getIsbnWithEmptyString
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getIsbn method when an empty string is used as ISBN.
Execution:
    Arrange: We need to set `isbn` as an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getIsbn method.
    Assert: The expected output should be an empty string.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the `getIsbn` method handles empty strings and returns the same rather than throwing an error.

Scenario 4: Testing the getIsbn method with special characters

Details:
  TestName: getIsbnWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the getIsbn method when a string with special characters is used.
Execution:
    Arrange: We need to set `isbn` as a string containing special characters.
    Act: Invoke the getIsbn method.
    Assert: The expected output should be the string with special characters.
Validation: 
    The assertion will aim to verify that the method can handle strings with special characters without any loss of information or errors.
