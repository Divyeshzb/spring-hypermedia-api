================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Untrusted input CWE-20
Issue: The method 'add' of class is publicly exposed and can add any 'Book' which can also be created/modified externally. This can lead to data integrity issues if the 'Book' object is not properly validated before being added.
Solution: Use encapsulation to ensure that 'Book' type data is validated. You can encapsulate the validation logic within an 'addBook(Book book)' method inside the class containing this List.

Vulnerability: Missing synchronization CWE-662
Issue: In a multi-threaded environment where instances of this class are shared across threads, concurrent attempts to add a book can lead to race conditions or other unforeseen effects.
Solution: Add the 'synchronized' keyword to the 'add' method to ensure thread safety in a multi-threaded environment.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Add a valid book to the list

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddingValidBook
    Description: This test is meant to check if a valid book object can be added successfully to the list. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid Book object. 
    Act: Invoke the add method with the created Book object. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the object that was added to the list with the Book object used as input.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that a valid book object can be added successfully to the books list. It confirms that the add method behaves as expected when used appropriately.

Scenario 2: Add a null object to the list

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddingNullBook
    Description: This test is meant to check if a null object is handled successfully by the add method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange step for this test as the input is null.
    Act: Invoke the add method with a null object. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the list size hasn't increased.
  Validation: 
    This assertion checks that null input does not corrupt the list or increase its size. It confirms that the add method can handle null input appropriately.

Scenario 3: Add a book that already exists in the list

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddingDuplicateBook
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the add method when a duplicate book object is added to the list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Add a Book object to the list.
    Act: Invoke the add method with the same Book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the list size hasn't increased and there's no duplicate Book object in the list.
  Validation: 
    The assertion validates that no duplicate Book object can be added into the list. It underscores that the add method behaves as expected when a duplicate object is added.

Scenario 4: Add a book when the list is full

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddingBookWhenListIsFull
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the add method when a book is added to a full collection. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Fill the list with valid Book objects until it's full.
    Act: Invoke the add method with another Book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check for exception behavior or verify that the list size is still at its maximum limit.
  Validation: 
    This assertion validates that the add method behaves as expected when a book is added to a full list, either by throwing exception or not allowing additional books.
