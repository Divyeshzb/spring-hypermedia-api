================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Weak Hashing Algorithm Potential Usage
Issue: While no hashing function is directly used in this code snippet, since it's a part of a model and uses javax.persistence, it might interact with a database. Using weak hashing algorithms (like MD5, SHA-1) can lead to vulnerabilities, especially in password-protected systems.
Solution: Ensure to use strong, cryptographically secure hashing algorithms (such as Argon2, PBKDF2, Scrypt, Bcrypt) whenever necessary.

Vulnerability: Potential Information Leakage via Debug Information
Issue: In the given Java class, if this is a production code snippet, debug information or comments that might reveal database structure, business logic, or other critical application insights may be present in other parts of the class. Developers often leave such information in the code which can be a security vulnerability.
Solution: Clean up the comments or debug information before moving into production. Also optionally, obfuscate the code for an additional layer of security.

Vulnerability: Unsanitized User Input
Issue: The getter method implies user interaction. If setters and other input handlers do not sanitize user input, the application risks SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and similar input-based attacks.
Solution: Sanitize user inputs and use prepared statements for SQL queries. Follow the principle of least privilege while dealing with user inputs.

Vulnerability: Potential Missing Access Controls
Issue: Given goods constructor and getter methods without any access modifiers suggests potential issues with access control. Insufficient access control can lead to unauthorized access and data breach.
Solution: Ensure that all methods have appropriate access control. Use private wherever needed and restrict access to sensitive functions and data.

Vulnerability: Default Package Usage
Issue: The class declaration is missing, indicating that the class is using a default package. If the package is used without declaration, it could lead to namespace collisions and unauthorized access to classes or interfaces.
Solution: Declare proper namespaces for classes, avoid using a default, unnamed package.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Synopsis
  Details:
    TestName: testForValidSynopsis
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method is able to return valid synopsis when it's called.
  Execution:
    Arrange: N/A, as no setup is required here.
    Act: Call the getSynopsis() method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned synopsis string matches the expected value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method getSynopsis() returns the correct synopsis. It validates the method's fundamental functionality of getting the synopsis correctly.
  
Scenario 2: Test for Null Synopsis Value
  Details:
    TestName: testForNullSynopsis
    Description: This test is meant to verify the functionality of the method when null is set as the synopsis.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set null as a synopsis.
    Act: Call the getSynopsis() method.
    Assert: Validate that the returned value from the method is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that when the synopsis is set to null, the method gets the null synopsis properly. This ensures that the method can appropriately handle a null scenario without errors.
  
Scenario 3: Test for Empty Synopsis Value
  Details:
    TestName: testForEmptySynopsis
    Description: This test is meant to validate how the method behaves when an empty string is set as the synopsis.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set an empty string as a synopsis.
    Act: Call the getSynopsis() method.
    Assert: Check if the returned synopsis from the method is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if empty strings are handled correctly by the method. This test is important in the context of handling scenarios without content in the synopsis.

Scenario 4: Test for Synopsis with White Spaces
  Details:
    TestName: testForSynopsisWithWhiteSpace
    Description: This test is to check the functionality of the method when synopses with white spaces are used.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set white spaces as a synopsis.
    Act: Invoke the getSynopsis() method.
    Assert: Confirm if the returned synopsis from the method is equal to the white spaces.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to check the handling of white spaces as an input synopsis by the getSynopsis() method.
