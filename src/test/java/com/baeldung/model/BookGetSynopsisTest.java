================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-090: LDAP Injection
Issue: If user-provided data is used to construct an LDAP query, without proper sanitization, it can lead to an LDAP injection attack.
Solution: Use parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements. Validate and sanitize user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-079: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If user-supplied data included in HTML pages without proper escaping, it might lead to XSS attacks.
Solution: Use appropriate response escaping methods. Always validate and sanitize user input.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test to validate returns of 'getSynopsis' method. 
Details: 
  TestName: validateReturnOfGetSynopsis
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of 'getSynopsis' method, specifically the return value. As the mentioned method does not require any parameters, there are no conditions to manage here. The main goal is to ensure the method successfully returns a synopsis as expected. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for data arrangement in this scenario since 'getSynopsis' does not accept any parameters.
  Act: Call the 'getSynopsis' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit to assert that the outcome (return value) of the function matches the expected return value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to check if the 'getSynopsis' method returns a synopsis as expected or intended. If the test passes, it signifies that the method is correctly retrieving the synopsis data. 
  
Scenario 2: Test to check error handling of 'getSynopsis'.
Details: 
  TestName: checkErrorHandlingOfGetSynopsis
  Description: This test aims to check how 'getSynopsis' handles instances when there is no synopsis to return, which might happen when the synopsis is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the synopsis to be null.
  Act: Call the 'getSynopsis' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit to assert that the method returns null.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the 'getSynopsis' function appropriately handles cases where there isn't a synopsis to return. It supports ensuring that the method can handle edge cases and minimizes the potential for exceptions that could disrupt the application workflow. 

Scenario 3: Test to verify thread-safety of 'getSynopsis'.
Details: 
  TestName: verifyThreadSafetyOfGetSynopsis
  Description: This test aims to validate the thread safety of 'getSynopsis' when concurrent threads are trying to access the synopsis.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple threads that will call 'getSynopsis' concurrently.
  Act: Run all the threads.
  Assert: Use JUnit to assert that all threads return the same synopsis.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the thread-safety of 'getSynopsis'. In a real-world scenario, this is important as it verifies the method's functionality when multiple threads are involved. If passed, it means the method operates as expected under concurrent access.
