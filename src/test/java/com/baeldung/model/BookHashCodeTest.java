================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-780: Use of hashCode() in a way that leads to inequalities for potentially equal objects
Issue: Using hashCode() like this could lead to potentially equal objects having different hash codes, which could lead to unexpected behavior in certain instances. Moreover, it may affect the application's performance when many objects are stored in a HashMap or HashSet.
Solution: Ensure that any overriding of hashCode() complies with the general contract as specified by Object.hashCode(). Also, consider using modern IDEs that can generate these methods automatically which can substantially reduce the likelihood of introducing a bug.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Although not apparent directly from the code snippet, when dealing with user inputs in the form of `author`, `isbn`, `title`, it's critical to ensure that these inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent issues like SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), etc.
Solution: Always validate, sanitize and escape user input. Make use of Java's built-in or third-party libraries such as the OWASP Java Encoder for HTML content.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Testing hashCode method when author, title, and isbn are not null
  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeWithAllFieldsNotNull
    Description: This test is meant to check if the hashCode method correctly generates a unique hash code when all fields (author, title, isbn) are not null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the entity object with a sample author, title, and isbn.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created entity.
    Assert: Validate if the returned hash code is unique and not zero.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify whether the hash code generated is unique and not zero. The expected result is significant to ensure that the hash function's uniqueness mechanism works properly. 

Scenario 2: Testing hashCode method when author, title, and isbn are null
  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeWithAllFieldsNull
    Description: The purpose of this test is to verify if the hashCode method can handle null input values and returns a valid output without throwing any exceptions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the entity object with null values for author, title, and isbn.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created entity.
    Assert: Assert if the returned hash code is exactly one.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method appropriately handles null inputs and whether it returns a value of one, as expected by the hashCode method when all the properties are null.

Scenario 3: Testing hashCode method when some of the fields are null
  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeWithSomeFieldsNull
    Description: This test will check how the hashCode method behaves when some of the fields (not all) are null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the entity object with null values for some of the properties such as author and isbn but non-null for title.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created entity.
    Assert: Assert the returned hash code is not zero and unique.
  Validation: 
    The assertion looks to validate whether the hash code generated is unique even when some of the properties are null. It also checks if the result is not zero, establishing the testâ€™s significance in the context of partial null property handling.

Scenario 4: Stress Testing hashCode method
  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeStressTest
    Description: This test will stress test the hashCode method by checking its performance with a large set of data.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize multiple entity objects with non-null values.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method for all the entities and record the execution time.
    Assert: Assert whether the execution time adheres to the performance expectations.
  Validation: 
    The purpose here is to validate that the hash code method can handle a large dataset efficiently within a good performance range, ensuring that it scales well and maintains performance even under stress.
