================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Sending sensitive data (like auth tokens) in URL strings can expose information to unauthorized actors. URLs are also logs, meaning potentially sensitive data can be stored in web server logs or other places.
Solution: Always use HTTP POST method over HTTP GET method while sending sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: Sensitive data should be encrypted during transmission and at rest. If it's not, an attacker may eavesdrop during transmission, or read the data directly from storage.
Solution: Always use industry-standard cryptographic protocols to encrypt sensitive data during transmission and at rest.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: Transmitting sensitive data in clear text can expose it to interception by unauthorized actors.
Solution: Ensure sensitive data is always transmitted over secured channels (like HTTPS) and encrypted whenever possible.

Vulnerability: CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
Issue: Unintentionally inserting sensitive information into log files could expose it to unauthorized users with read access to the logs.
Solution: Make sure that your application does not log sensitive data, and all log files should have appropriate access control.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for null author, isbn, and title
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullFields
  Description: This test will check the functionality of the hashCode method when author, isbn and title are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: The author, isbn and title fields are set to null within the test method.
  Act: The hashCode method is invoked for the Book object.
  Assert: Assert that the computed hashcode equals 1.
Validation: 
  This test is important as it checking the result when all fields are null. The expected result is 1 because when all values are null, the result variable remains unchanged.

Scenario 2: Test with valid author, isbn and title
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithValidFields
  Description: This test will ensure that the hashCode method operates correctly with valid field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: The author, isbn, and title fields are set to valid non-null values.
  Act: The hashCode method is invoked for the Book object.
  Assert: Assert that the computed hashcode equals the expected hashcode result.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly computes the hashcode for a valid object. The method should follow the correct algorithm for these different field values.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string fields
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithEmptyStrings
  Description: This test will check the behavior of hashCode method when author, isbn, and title are empty strings.
Execution:
  Arrange: The author, isbn, and title fields are set to empty string.
  Act: The hashCode method is invoked for the Book object.
  Assert: Assert that the computed hashcode equals the expected hashcode result for empty strings.
Validation: 
  This test ensures that the hashCode method handles empty strings correctly. It is important to verify that even empty strings, though not a null, still contribute to the hashcode calculation.

Scenario 4: Test with same field values on different objects
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithSameFieldValues
  Description: This test will verify that two Book objects with the same field values have the same hashcode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two book objects are created with identical author, isbn, and title values.
  Act: The hashCode method is invoked for both the Book objects.
  Assert: Assert that the computed hashcodes for both objects are equal.
Validation: 
  This test validates the principle that two equal objects must share the same hashcode. This is fundamental to the contract of the hashCode method.
