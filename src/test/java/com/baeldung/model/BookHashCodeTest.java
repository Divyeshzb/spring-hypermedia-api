================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Absence of @Entity Annotation
Issue: The class seems to be a model for a database table but lacks the @Entity annotation. It is termed as a Persistent class or Model called by Hibernate. Without proper declaration, it won't be recognized by Spring JPA or Hibernate ORM.
Solution: Include import javax.persistence.Entity; and annotate the class with @Entity.

Vulnerability: Absence of Class Definition
Issue: The code provided lacks the class definition. This could create confusion about the nature of the methods or variables used in the class.
Solution: Encapsulate the provided code in an appropriate public class { ... } structure.

Vulnerability: Unbounded Context
Issue: The hashCode() method is free-floating and its context isn't clear. Java does not support standalone methods, they need to be in a class.
Solution: Place this method under the proper class from which the properties are referenced or ensure these properties are available in the current class context.

"""
 Scenario 1: Test when author, isbn and title are null

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithAllNullFields
    Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode() method when all the input fields (author, isbn, and title) are null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a Book object with all fields (author, isbn, and title) as null. 
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the book.
    Assert: The expected result is 1, as no fields are present to contribute to the hash code.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the hashCode method correctly handles null fields without throwing an exception and returns 1 when no fields are present.

 Scenario 2: Test when author field is non-null, and isbn, title are null

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullAuthor
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the method when only author field is non-null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a Book object with non-null author and null isbn and title.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the book.
    Assert: The expected result is the hashCode of the author multiplied by the prime number(31) plus 1.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the hashCode method correctly calculates the hash code when only the author field is non-null, and still handles the other null fields without error.

 Scenario 3: Test when isbn field is non-null, and author, title are null

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullIsbn
    Description: This test checks to see what happens when only the isbn field isn't null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the book object up with a non-null isbn and null author and title.
    Act: Method hashCode() is invoked on the book.
    Assert: The expected outcome is the hashCode of the isbn multiplied by the prime number(31) plus 1.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the hashCode method correctly calculates the hash code when only the isbn is not null, and null fields do not present any problems.

 Scenario 4: Test when title field is non-null, and author, isbn are null

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullTitle
    Description: This test is intended to see what the method does when only the title field is non-null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a book object with a non-null title and null author and isbn.
    Act: Invoke the method hashCode on the book.
    Assert: The expected result is the hashCode of the title multiplied by the prime number(31) plus 1.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the hashCode method correctly calculates the hash code when only the title is non-null, and null fields do not present an error.

Scenario 5: Test when all fields are non-null

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithAllNonNullFields
    Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when all fields (author, isbn, and title) are not null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a book object with non-null author, isbn, and title.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the book.
    Assert: The expected result is the sum of the hash codes of all fields (author, isbn, and title), each multiplied by the prime number(31) plus 1.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the method correctly calculates the hash code when all fields are not null. The result should represent a unique identifier for the book object based on these three fields.
