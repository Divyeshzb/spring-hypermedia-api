ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Object Equality Checking - CWE-597
Issue: In the hashCode() method, object equality is checked using reference comparison (author == null), not their content. This can lead to unexpected behavior if objects with the same content but different instances are compared.
Solution: Consider using Objects.equals() method to properly check the equality of objects based on their content, not on their reference.

Vulnerability: Null Pointer Dereference - CWE-476
Issue: The hashcode() method can cause a Null Pointer Exception(NPE) if the objects author, isbn or title have not been initialized before its use.
Solution: Add a null check before using any object. Additionally, consider using Optional class in Java to avoid null references and prevent Null pointer exceptions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when all properties are present
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithAllProperties()
  Description: The test aims to check the hashCode() method runs correctly and returns the expected result when all properties (author, isbn, title) are non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the subject with all properties set to non-null values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method.
  Assert: Get the expected result by manually calculating the expected hash value and then compare it with the actual result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode() method correctly calculates the hash when all properties are non-null. The significance of this test is to make sure the hashCode() method works as expected in the common scenario.

Scenario 2: Test when all properties are null
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullProperties()
  Description: The test aims to check the hashCode() method returns the correct result when all properties (author, isbn, title) are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the subject with all properties null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method.
  Assert: The returned hash should be equal to 1 since all properties are null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode() method correctly calculates the hash when all properties are null. This test is significant because it covers an edge case where all properties are null.

Scenario 3: Test when some properties are null
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithSomeNullProperties()
  Description: This test is designed to validate the hashCode() method where some properties are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the subject with some properties null and some non-null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method.
  Assert: Get the expected result by manually calculating the expected hash value considering the null values and then compare it with the actual result.
Validation: 
  The assertion seeks to confirm that the hashCode() method correctly handles some properties being null, providing the correct hash in return. This is important as it tests the robustness of the hashCode() method to various property configurations.

Scenario 4: Test that hashCode() method returns same result for two identical objects.
Details: 
  TestName: testHashCodeForIdenticalObjects()
  Description: This test aims to ensure that two identically properties objects will generate the same hash code.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Instantiate two objects with identical properties.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method for both objects.
  Assert: The hashcodes of both objects should be the same.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that hashcodes are the same for identical objects. This test is significant to ensure consistency and correctness of the hashCode() method.
