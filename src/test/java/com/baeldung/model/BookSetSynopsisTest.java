ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setSynopsis_25c70b9ff9

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The 'setSynopsis' function might potentially be persistent on the client side and result in sensitive data exposure if used improperly.
Solution: Avoid storing sensitive data in client-side persistence APIs. Use HTTPS to secure data in transit in the eventual case of execution.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: Direct object references can be manipulated by malicious actors to bypass authorization and access sensitive data.
Solution: Implement indirect object references through a mapping to the actual database identifiers.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
Issue: In case the entity to which 'setSynopsis' is decorating gets stored in the database, encryption is needed for securing sensitive data.
Solution: Hash user credentials and other sensitive data before storing them in the database. Use strong hash functions with a random salt.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The 'setSynopsis' function might cause a privacy violation if it's used to set sensitive user data.
Solution: Ensure the given function doesn't manipulate sensitive data or confirm that it's obeying all necessary privacy regulations if it does.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: An attacker can trick users into performing actions they didn't intend to.
Solution: Implement anti-forgery tokens and ensure they're included with every client request that changes the application state.
