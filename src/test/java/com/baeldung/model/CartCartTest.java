================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
Issue: All objects should be properly initialized before they're used. If they're not, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.
Solution: Ensure that all objects are initialized properly before using.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (‘Resource Exhaustion’)
Issue: The usage of a List object in Java can sometimes lead to OutOfMemoryErrors if not managed correctly, especially if large amount of data is being stored in the List.
Solution: Developers should keep track of how much data is being stored in the List at all times or use data structures that don't have this issue.

Vulnerability: CWE-789: Uncontrolled Memory Allocation
Issue: Using ArrayList for storing data can lead to excessive memory allocation leading to OutOfMemoryError if the size of the list gets too large.
Solution: Check for possible memory leaks and unnecessary data storing. Set maximum capacity for ArrayList if applicable.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Cart Initialization Test
  Details:  
    TestName: testCartInitialization.
    Description: This test is to check whether a new cart is initialized correctly. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No pre-arrangement needed as we only need to call the method.
    Act: Create a new cart instance.
    Assert: Verify that the books list inside the cart is empty.
  Validation: 
    This will confirm that each new cart is initialized with an empty book list. This consistency is crucial to ensure that books from previous transactions will not interfere with the new ones.

Scenario 2: List Access from Cart test
  Details:  
    TestName: testCartListAccess.
    Description: This test checks if the books in a cart can be accessed after cart creation. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new cart instance.
    Act: Try to access the book list from the cart instance.
    Assert: Verify that the accessed object is indeed a List of books.
  Validation: 
    This ensures that the cart's encapsulation works correctly, as it allows safe access to the list of books for other operations such as adding or removing items.

Scenario 3: Cart Isolation test
  Details:  
    TestName: testCartIsolation.
    Description: The test is meant to verify that each created cart works independently.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two new cart instances.
    Act: Add different books to each cart.
    Assert: Verify that each cart maintains its respective list of books.
  Validation: 
    This test shows the significance of having different cart instances being isolated from each other, which is particularly important when dealing with multiple users or sessions in an application.

Scenario 4: Exception handling test for Null Book Inclusion
  Details:
    TestName: testExceptionForNullBookAddition.
    Description: This test aims to verify that the program handles attempts to add a null book to the cart correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new cart instance.
    Act: Attempt to add a null book to the cart.
    Assert: An appropriate exception is thrown or error is handled.
  Validation:
    The test validates that the code is robust to null inputs, enhancing the program's reliability by ensuring that it doesn't crash when encountering invalid inputs.
