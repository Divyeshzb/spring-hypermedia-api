ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getBooks_9722ce6c80

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Leakage (CWE-200)
Issue: When the reference to a mutable data structure (like an ArrayList) is returned directly from a class, it could possibly be misused or modified unintentionally, leading to information leaks.
Solution: To prevent the misuse of mutable data types, you could return a copy of the original data or use Java's Collections.unmodifiableList() method to return an unmodifiable view of the list.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Non-Empty List of Books
  Details:
    TestName: testNonEmptyBookList.
    Description: This test checks that the method 'getBooks()' returns a non-empty list of books.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a list of 'Book', with one or more book elements inside.
    Act: Invoke the 'getBooks()' method.
    Assert: Assert that the list received from the method is not empty.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the list returned by 'getBooks()' is not empty. This is expected, as we instantiate the list with one or more book elements prior to the test. Success confirms that the method correctly accesses the list of books.

Scenario 2: Test for Empty List of Books
  Details:
    TestName: testEmptyBookList.
    Description: This test ascertains that the 'getBooks()' method can return an empty list of books if there are no books present in the list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an empty list of 'Book'.
    Act: Invoke the 'getBooks()' method.
    Assert: Assert that the list received from the method is empty.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the list returned by 'getBooks()' is empty. This is the expected behavior when there are no books in the list, ensuring that the method handles such scenarios correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for Null Reference
  Details:
    TestName: testNullReferenceBookList.
    Description: This test confirms that the 'getBooks()' method throws a NullPointerException when it attempts to access a null reference to the book list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not instantiate the book list.
    Act: Invoke the 'getBooks()' method.
    Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The test verifies that a NullPointerException is thrown when 'getBooks()' tries to access a null reference to the book list. This is expected behavior, ensuring that the 'getBooks()' method handles null references properly.

Scenario 4: Test for List of Books Integrity
  Details:
    TestName: testBookListIntegrity.
    Description: This test aims to ensure that the 'getBooks()' method returns the book list without altering its original state.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a list of 'Book' with specific books.
    Act: Invoke the 'getBooks()' method and then compare the returned list with the original list.
    Assert: Assert that the returned list equals the original list.
  Validation:
    The test aims to verify that 'getBooks()' returns the exact book list without performing any alterations. This ensures the integrity and correctness of the method.
