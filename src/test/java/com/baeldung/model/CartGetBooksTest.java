================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If the 'books' object is sensitive data and accessible in the global context, it might be prone to IDOR attacks as it seems directly accessible.
Solution: Ensure that proper access control checks and input validation are put in place before the data is accessed or returned. This might mean implementing authorization checks.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through Sent Data (CWE-201)
Issue: Returning a potentially sensitive object, such as 'books', without validating or sanitizing it could risk data leakage.
Solution: Ensure potentially sensitive data is not included in the returned object, or ensure the object is properly treated before itâ€™s returned. Use an allowlist of what data it is safe to return and ensure all other data is properly handled or removed from the responses.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79)
Issue: If the data in the 'books' object is output to a webpage without proper encoding, it could potentially cause cross-site scripting (XSS) issues.
Solution: Always encode data that is to be output to a webpage in an HTML context. This prevents potentially malicious scripts from being injected into the page.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate if the getBooks method returns a list of books as expected

Details:
TestName: validateGetBooksReturn
Description: This test aims to validate if the getBooks method is returning a list of Book objects as expected.
Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a Book class and add Book objects to the list of books.
Act: Invoke getBooks() method
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the returned List contains the added books and is of the correct size.
Validation:
The assertion aims to confirm that the getBooks method works properly by returning the list of expected Book objects. This is important to validate that the list of books can be correctly retrieved and used in the application.


Scenario 2: Check if the getBooks method returns an empty list when no books were added 

Details:
TestName: validateGetBooksEmptyReturn
Description: This test aims to check the behavior of the getBooks method when no books were added to the list
Execution:
Arrange: Do not add any books to the list.
Act: Invoke getBooks() method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned list of books is empty.
Validation:
The assertion aims to check if getBooks correctly handles the situation when no books were added, by returning an empty list. This validation is crucial since the application should handle such edge cases without failing or throwing exceptions.


Scenario 3: Validate the order of books returned by the getBooks method

Details:
TestName: validateGetBooksOrder
Description: This test aims to check if the order of books in the list corresponds to the order in which they were added.
Execution:
Arrange: Add books to the list in a specific sequence.
Act: Invoke getBooks() method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the order of books in the returned list with the order in which they were added.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that getBooks keeps the order of books intact. This is significant as in certain contexts, the order in which books were added might matter for processing or displaying information.

  
  Scenario 4: Validate the immutability of the list returned by the getBooks method

  Details:  
    TestName: validateImmutableReturnFromGetBooks.
    Description: This test aims to check if modifications to the list returned by getBooks, do not affect the actual list of books. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Extract the list from getBooks, modify it by adding or removing a book.
    Act: Again, invoke getBooks() method.
    Assert: Ensure that getBooks return the original list, not the modified one.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the returned list from getBooks is a new list, not a reference to the original list. This is important for data security and to prevent accidental modification of the original list.
