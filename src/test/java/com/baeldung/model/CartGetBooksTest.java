================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential Unmodifiability of Returned List
Issue: By directly returning a mutable object like List, you may allow the caller to modify its contents which could lead to potential data manipulation issues.
Solution: Consider returning an unmodifiable view of the list, using `Collections.unmodifiableList(books);`. It provides a way to share functionality without giving up the control of the original List.

================================================================================
1. 
  Scenario 1: Test to validate the correctness of populated list of Books 
  Details:  
    TestName: testBooksListCorrectness
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the getBooks method returns the expected list of books stored in the 'books' variable or not. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the 'books' variable with a known list of books. 
    Act: Invoke the getBooks method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit to compare the returned list of books with the expected list of books.
  Validation: 
    This assertion is verifying that the getBooks method is correctly returning the list of books stored in the 'books' variable. The correct behavior of this method is fundamental for other operations related to books management.

2.
  Scenario 2: Test to validate the handling of empty list of Books
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetBooksWhenEmpty
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the getBooks method functions correctly when the 'books' variable contains no books. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the 'books' variable as an empty list. 
    Act: Invoke the getBooks method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit to assert that the returned list of books from the getBooks method is empty. 
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the getBooks method can handle scenarios where the 'books' variable is empty.

3.
  Scenario 3: Test to validate the correct handling of null value
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetBooksWhenNull
    Description: This test is meant to check how the getBooks method behaves when the 'books' variable is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the 'books' variable to null. 
    Act: Invoke the getBooks method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit to assert that the getBooks method returns null.
  Validation:
    This test will verify if the method is robust enough to handle null values and does not cause any NullPointerException. This is critical for ensuring that the application can fail gracefully in case the 'books' variable is not initialized. 

4.
  Scenario 4: Test for method's immutability property
  Details:
    TestName: testGetBooksImmutability
    Description: The test is meant to check if the getBooks method maintains the immutability property, i.e., changes to the returned Books list do not affect the original list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Get a list of books from the getBooks method and add/remove a Book from this list. 
    Act: Invoke the getBooks method again.
    Assert: Use JUnit to compare the second returned list of Books with the first list (before the change).
  Validation: 
    The assertion will verify that the getBooks method is ensuring the immutability of the 'books' variable. This is important for encapsulation and data integrity.
