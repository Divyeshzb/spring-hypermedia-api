================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unintended Accessibility or Modification of Private Data
Issue: Returning a reference to a mutable object directly exposes this object. It may be inadvertently or maliciously modified, compromising both data integrity and security.
Solution: Return a defensive copy of the mutable object to prevent it from being modified. For instance, instead of `return books;` where `books` is assumed to be a List<Book> instance, a safer option employs `return new ArrayList<>(books);`.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Testing whether the getBooks method returns the correct list of books

Details:  
  TestName: testCorrectListOfBooksReturned.
  Description: This test verifies that the getBooks method returns the correct list of books which have been set. The scenario targets the primary functionality of the getBooks method, which should provide the accurate list of books that exist in the system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a known list of Book objects and set them to the 'books' field of the object under test.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method which should return the list of books.
  Assert: Compare the returned list of books with the expected list using JUnit assertions.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getBooks method returns the correct list of books. The expected result is that the returned list should be the same as the prepared list of books. This test is essential to ensure the integrity of data return by the getBooks method. 

Scenario 2: Verify the getBooks method returns an empty list when there are no books

Details:  
  TestName: testEmptyListOfBooksReturnedWhenNoBooks.
  Description: This test checks that getBooks method is able to handle scenarios where there are no books. It is meant to verify that the method does not throw an exception, instead returns an empty list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure 'books' field of the object under test is an empty list.
  Act: Call the getBooks method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned list is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the getBooks method is robust enough to handle scenarios where there are no books. The expected result is an empty list. It is essential for the getBooks method to behave consistently even when there are no books in the system.

Scenario 3: Test if the getBooks method returns an unmodifiable list

Details:  
  TestName: testListReturnedIsUnmodifiable.
  Description: This test is to ensure the getBooks method does not expose the internal representation of the 'books' list. By ensuring the returned list cannot be modified, we maintain the encapsulation of the class.
Execution:
   Arrange: Setup 'books' field of the object under test with some book objects.
   Act: Call the getBooks method and attempt to add a new book to the returned list.
   Assert: Catch the resulting UnsupportedOperationException, if thrown, the test case is considered as pass.
Validation: 
  The validation here is to ensure the encapsulation of the class is not broken. The expected result here is an UnsupportedOperationException. It is essential to ensure the class behaves as a truly encapsulated unit.
