================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: Java Persistence API (JPA) is being used to handle data persistence, this library is not always safe for storing sensitive data due to its lack of features for encrypting fields in the database.
Solution: Store sensitive data fields (such as ISBN) differently. Consider using libraries/frameworks that offer the ability to encrypt specific data fields before they are stored in the database, or manually encrypt fields using an accepted secure algorithm before persisting them.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The imported Jackson library, without properly configuration, might lead to 'JavaScript Hijacking', where an array in JavaScript object notation (JSON) format can be interpreted as JavaScript by some web browsers.
Solution: You should ensure that the JsonView configurations on Jackson library are correctly set for your purposes. A helpful mitigation lead is to prepend JSON responses with a prefix that renders them unusable as JavaScript when directly included in a script context.

Vulnerability: CWE-246: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The current model constructor is taking three parameters (author, title, isbn) without performing any sort of validation around them. This can lead to a situation where untrusted data is used in security-critical context.
Solution: Consider add input validation and sanitization before using or storing the data. Libraries such as Apache Commons Validator can assist with this.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing a Successful Book Creation
  Details: 
    TestName: testBookCreationWithValidInput
    Description: This test is meant to check if the Book method can successfully create a book object with valid parameters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide valid values for the variables "author", "title", and "isbn".
    Act: Invoke the Book method with the arranged values.
    Assert: Confirms that the created Book object's author, title, and isbn match the input. 
  Validation: 
    This verifies that a Book object is successfully created when provided with valid inputs for "author", "title", and "isbn". It is crucial because the system needs to accurately register new book information.

Scenario 2: Testing Book Creation with Null Input
  Details: 
    TestName: testBookCreationWithNullInput
    Description: This test checks whether the Book method can handle null parameters appropriately.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide null values for the variables "author", "title", and "isbn".
    Act: Invoke the Book method with the arranged null values.
    Assert: Assert that the implementation throws an error or takes appropriate action when provided with null values.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the application does not crash when null values are passed to the method and handles it as expected. The significance of this test lies in ensuring the robustness of the application in the face of unexpected input.

Scenario 3: Testing Book Creation with Empty String Input
  Details: 
    TestName: testBookCreationWithEmptyString
    Description: This test checks if the Book method can correctly handle empty string inputs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide empty strings for the variables "author", "title", and "isbn".
    Act: Invoke the Book method with the arranged empty strings.
    Assert: The implementation throws an error or takes appropriate action when provided with empty string values.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the system behaves as expected when it receives an empty string as input. It allows the application to maintain data integrity by preventing the creation of a book with empty author, title, or ISBN.

Scenario 4: Testing Book Creation with Special Characters in Input
  Details: 
    TestName: testBookCreationWithSpecialCharInput
    Description: This test is used to check if the Book method can correctly handle special characters in its input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Include special characters in the variables "author", "title", and "isbn".
    Act: Invoke the Book method with variables containing special characters.
    Assert: Ensure that the implementation handles these special characters correctly, either by throwing an error or creating the book with the given inputs.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the system behaves as expected when provided with special characters in the input, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and protecting against possible security risks.
