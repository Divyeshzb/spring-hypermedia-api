ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint
Issue: The use of hashCode() could potentially expose sensitive information. An attacker can guess hash values by observing hash-collision timing discrepancies or by locating a data object in memory.
Solution: Avoid using the hashCode() method for sensitive data. If unavoidable, ensure strong hash function to avoid hash related attack and also perform regular security audits to detect discrepancies.

Vulnerability: CWE-374: Passing Mutable Objects
Issue: If 'books' is a collection of mutable objects, even if the reference to this collection is final and cannot be modified, the objects contained within the collection can be changed, which could expose your application to security risks.
Solution: To mitigate this, always return a copy of the mutable object or an unmodifiable view.

================================================================================
""" 
Scenario 1: Test hashCode when books is null and purchased is false

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWhenBooksIsNullAndPurchasedIsFalse
  Description: The test scenario is developed to test the hashCode method when the 'books' variable is null and 'purchased' is false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize 'books' to null and 'purchased' to false in a test object.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the test object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is 1237 which is the expected result when 'books' is null and 'purchased' is false.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the return value of hashCode method is calculated correctly based on the formula given within the method body. This scenario tests the lower edge case where 'books' is null and 'purchased' is false.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode when books is null and purchased is true

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWhenBooksIsNullAndPurchasedIsTrue
  Description: The test scenario aims to test the hashCode method when the 'books' variable is null and 'purchased' is true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize 'books' to null and 'purchased' to true in a test object.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the test object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is 1231 which is the expected result when 'books' is null and 'purchased' is true.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the return value of hashCode method is calculated correctly based on the formula given within the method body. This scenario tests the case where 'books' is null and 'purchased' is true.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode when books is not null and purchased is false

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWhenBooksIsNotNullAndPurchasedIsFalse
  Description: The test scenario is meant to check the hashCode method when 'books' is not null and 'purchased' is false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize 'books' to a non-null value and 'purchased' to false in a test object.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the test object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is calculated correctly considering the 'books' hashCode and 'purchased' value in the formula.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the return value of hashCode method is calculated correctly based on the formula given within the method body. This scenario tests the case where 'books' is an actual list and 'purchased' is false.

Scenario 4: Test hashCode when books is not null and purchased is true

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWhenBooksIsNotNullAndPurchasedIsTrue
  Description: The test scenario is checking hashCode method when 'books' is not null and 'purchased' is true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize 'books' to a non-null value and 'purchased' to true in a test object.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the test object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is calculated correctly considering the 'books' hashCode and 'purchased' value in the formula.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the return value of hashCode method is calculated correctly based on the formula given in the method body. This scenario tests the scenario where 'books' is an actual list and 'purchased' is true.
