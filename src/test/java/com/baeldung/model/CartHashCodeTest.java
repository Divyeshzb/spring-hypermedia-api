ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure object state
Issue: The misuse of mutable hashed objects can lead to inconsistent state and potential security vulnerabilities. If an object's hashCode changed after storing it in a collection, it could be difficult to retrieve it, or it could corrupt your collection.
Solution: Make sure that hashed objects remain immutable after their creation. In this code submission, 'books' and 'purchased' should be final. If 'books' is a list, ensure that it is unmodifiable after creation.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Validating hashcode for a non-empty object

Details:
  TestName: testHashcodeForNonEmptyObject
  Description: This test aims to verify the hashCode function for a fully populated object, ensuring it matches the expected result. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with populated 'books' fields and 'purchased' in true state.
  Act: call the hashCode method on the constructed object.
  Assert: Compare obtained hashcode with expected hashcode.
Validation:
  Expected Result: The hashcode resulted from using the formula in the method should match the obtained hashcode. This test validates the correct computation of hashcode according to the given formula.

Scenario 2: Validating hashcode for an object with null books field

Details:
  TestName: testHashcodeForNullBooksObject
  Description: This test aims to verify the hashCode function for an object where the 'books' field is null and 'purchased' is true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object where 'books' field is null and 'purchased' is true.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the created object.
  Assert: Compare the expected hashcode with the actual hashcode.
Validation:
  Expected Result: The hashcode should equal '1231', as per the formula provided. This test is to verify the correctness of the hashcode calculation when 'books' is null.

Scenario 3: Validating hashcode for an object with 'purchased' field set to false

Details:
  TestName: testHashcodeForUnpurchasedObject
  Description: This test aims to verify the hashCode function for an object where the 'books' field is populated, and 'purchased' is false. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object where the 'books' field is populated, and 'purchased' is set to false. 
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the created object.
  Assert: Compare the expected hashcode with the actual hashcode.
Validation:
  Expected Result: The hashcode should have the last four digits ending with '1237', according to the formula provided. This test validates the hashCode computation when 'purchased' is false.

Scenario 4: Comparing hashcodes of two identical objects 

Details:
  TestName: testHashcodeForIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check that two identical objects produce the same hashcode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical objects with the same 'books' field and 'purchased' state.
  Act: Generate the hashcodes for both objects using the hashCode method.
  Assert: Check that the two hashcodes are identical.
Validation:
  Expected Result: The hashcodes for both objects should be the same as identical objects must have the same hashcodes. This helps validate the behavior of the hashCode method and its consistency.
