================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Jackson Deserialization
Issue: Untrusted data is used in Object deserialization, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
Solution: Use @JsonCreator annotation for deserialization constructor, or avoid deserialization of classes that contain arbitrary code execution blocks.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: User can access other user's data by modifying values such as IDs.
Solution: Do not directly expose database primary keys. Consider using surrogate, non-sequential, client-facing IDs mapped to internal DB IDs.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: Untrusted input is directly used in HTML output, allowing an attacker to inject scripts and hijack user sessions.
Solution: Always encode user data that is presented as output.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection
Issue: User input is used in a database query without vetting, potentially exposing all data in database.
Solution: Always use parameterized query or Prepared Statements. Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check if Default Constructor Creates a Blank Book Object

Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultConstructorCreatesBlankObject
    Description: This test checks if the default constructor correctly initializes a Book entity object with all fields set to their default values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange part required as no initial setup is needed.
    Act: Invoke the default constructor of Book class.
    Assert: Check if the newly created object is not null and also check each property of Book to ensure they are at their default values (i.e., null for objects, 0 for int/float etc.).
  Validation: 
    This test validates if the default constructor correctly initializes an empty Book instance. The expected result is all fields should be at their default values since no initial values have been passed.

Scenario 2: Default Constructor Creates Distinct Book Instances

Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultConstructorCreatesDistinctInstances
    Description: This test verifies that every time the default constructor is called, it creates a distinct instance of the Book class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange part required as no initial setup is needed.
    Act: Create two instances of the Book class using its default constructor.
    Assert: Check if the references to both created objects are not the same.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the default constructor creates a new instance of the Book class whenever it's invoked, and it doesn't return a reference to the same instance. Hence, the expected result is two distinct Book instances.

Scenario 3: Default Constructor Does Not Throw an Exception 

Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultConstructorDoesNotThrowException
    Description: This test checks whether the default constructor throws any exception while creating a new instance of Book class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange part required as no initial setup is needed.
    Act: Attempt to instantiate a new Book object using the default constructor.
    Assert: Validate that no exception is thrown after the object instantiation.
  Validation: 
    This test checks if the default constructor behaves as expected in a nominal case and does not raise any exception. The expected result is no exception is thrown, indicating that the object instantiation was a success.
  
Note: For the Book class contains only a default constructor, as such, it is not possible to create more meaningful and diverse tests until there are setters, getters, and other methods involved.
