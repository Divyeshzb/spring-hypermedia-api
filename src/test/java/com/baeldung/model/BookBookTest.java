================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: Usage of `@JsonView` could potentially leak sensitive information if not handled properly. It's often used for debugging and sometimes left in production code by accident.
Solution: Ensure to remove `@JsonView` annotations or limit its usage in production code. Utilize role-based views instead.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: Javax Persistence API allows raw SQL executions which, if not correctly parameterized, could be vulnerable to SQL injection.
Solution: Always use parameterized queries or sanitize user inputs. Never construct SQL queries via string concatenation with unsanitized user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Using `@JsonIgnore` improperly can lead to sensitive information exposure. This is especially relevant when serializing an object that has a field containing sensitive data.
Solution: Be careful to apply `@JsonIgnore` to any sensitive data fields when using Jackson library for object serialization. Make sure not to expose any unnecessary fields in the serialized JSON.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate Book Instantiation

Details:  
   TestName: `validateBookInstantiation`.
   Description: This test is meant to check whether the Book object is instantiated correctly and all properties are initialized with default values.
Execution:
   Arrange: N/A as there is no need to setup any data for this basic object instantiation test.
   Act: Instantiate the Book object by invoking the default constructor. 
   Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check each property on the instantiated object matches the default values, this will include whether the object is null or not.
Validation: 
   Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. 
   Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. 

Scenario 2: Validate Object Identity Creation

Details: 
   TestName: `validateObjectIdentityCreation`.
   Description: This test checks whether the identity (hashCode) of the new object is created correctly.
Execution:
   Arrange: N/A as there is no need to setup any data for object instantiation.
   Act: Instantiate the Book object twice, creating two instances.
   Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hashCode of both instances, they shouldn't be the same because two different instances of book objects are created.
Validation:
   This assertion will validate that unique hashcodes are assigned to objects when they are created. This is significant to ensure instance uniqueness and avoid identity conflicts. 

Scenario 3: Validate Null Object Handling

Details: 
   TestName: `validateNullObjectHandling`.
   Description: This test aims to check the handling of null objects in the Book class.
Execution:
   Arrange: N/A as no setup is required to create a null object.
   Act: Declare a Book object but do not initialize it, leaving it null.
   Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the object is indeed null.
Validation:
   This assertion will validate the handling of scenarios where a Book object is declared but not initialized. This is important to prevent `NullPointerException` situations in the application logic.
