ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Book_efe3da2daf

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: No access control check is applied before accessing the books. Any user knowing the book id can view the information of the book if they modify the request.
Solution: Implement access control checks at the application level before accessing the resources. For instance, check if the logged-in user is the right one to access the book.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
Issue: The strings author, title, and isbn could be used to store a malicious script and execute it when another user views the book.
Solution: Encode the output whenever data is displayed back to ensure no script tags are processed by the website. Use in-built libraries to sanitize user-generated inputs.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: If the string parameters are used in a SQL query to the database, SQL injection can occur if theyâ€™re not properly sanitized.
Solution: Make sure to use PreparedStatement for SQL queries instead of Statement in Java to avoid SQL injection attacks.

================================================================================
""" 
Scenario 1: Correct Book Instantiation

Details:  
  TestName: createValidBookInstance.
  Description: The test aims to check the instantiation of the Book class with valid inputs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create string parameters for author, title and isbn.
    Act: Call the Book constructor with these parameters.
    Assert: Check if the created object is instance of Book.
  Validation: 
    The assertions verify that the class is instantiated correctly with valid inputs. This is crucial to ensure proper functioning of the application, as it heavily relies on objects of Book type.

Scenario 2: Empty String for Author Creation

Details:  
  TestName: createBookWithEmptyAuthor.
  Description: The test aims to check the instantiation of the Book class with empty string for author.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string for author while giving valid inputs for title and isbn.
    Act: Call the Book constructor with these parameters.
    Assert: Check if the created object is instance of Book and the author field is empty.
  Validation:
    The test asserts that the application allows creation of books with non mandatory attributes being empty. 

Scenario 3: Null For Title During Creation

Details:   
  TestName: createBookWithNullTitle.
  Description: The test is meant to check the behavior of the Book class when a null value is passed for the title parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the title parameter as null and provide valid inputs for author and isbn.
    Act: Invoke the Book constructor with these parameters.
    Assert: Verify if the object created is an instance of Book and the title attribute is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is to check if the application can handle null inputs for non-mandatory fields.

Scenario 4: ISBN Field Accepting Non-numeric Characters

Details:
  TestName: createBookWithNonNumericIsbn.
  Description: The test checks if non-numeric characters are accepted in the isbn field during instantiation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Input alphanumeric characters for isbn while giving valid inputs for author and title.
    Act: Construct a Book object with these parameters.
    Assert: Check if the created object is instance of Book with non-numeric isbn.
  Validation:
    The test ensures the application's flexibility in accepting non-traditional isbn formats. 

Scenario 5: Input Value Trimming

Details:  
  TestName: validatingInputTrim.
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the constructor trims extra spaces in the input parameters or not.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Input valid string parameters for author, title, and isbn with extra spaces.
    Act: Invoke the Book constructor with these parameters.
    Assert: Check if the created Book object's attributes are without extra spaces.
  Validation:  
    The test verifies whether the trimming works correctly to avoid unnecessary spaces in the data.
