================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure (OWASP Top 10-2021: A03)
Issue: Potential mishandling of sensitive data. The class field 'id' is able to be set without any control over who's setting it or what value it is being set to. If 'id' is sensitive data, allowing it to be freely updated could lead to potential data tampering and unauthorized data access.
Solution: Add access control methods or authentication procedures before the 'id' is updated. This strengthens the security of the data stored in 'id'.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (OWASP Top 10-2021: A04)
Issue: If 'id' is directly referencing database objects, an attacker could manipulate these references to gain unauthorized access to data.
Solution: Use indirect object references. Instead of exposing 'id' as direct object references, replace them with application-generated references back to these objects.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the Scenario when Id is set successfully

Details:  
 TestName: testSetIdWithValidId
 Description: This scenario is meant to check the functionality of the setId method when provided with a valid Long Id. The expected behavior is that the id of the object should be set corresponding to the provided Id.
 Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the object which the setId method belongs to.
  Act: Invoke the setId method with a valid long number.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set value with the expected value.
 Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the id was successfully set. If the id can be correctly set with valid Long value, then it confirms that our method is working correctly.

Scenario 2: Testing the Scenario when Id is set to null

Details:  
 TestName: testSetIdWithNullValue
 Description: This scenario is meant to check the functionality of the setId method when provided with a null value. The expected behavior is that the id of the object should be set to null.
 Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the object which the setId method belongs to.
  Act: Invoke the setId method with a null value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set id value with null.
 Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the id can be set to null. This test confirms that our method handles null values without crashing and it follows the nullable attribute's behavior in the @Id annotation.

Scenario 3: Testing the Scenario when extreme large value Id is tested
  
  Details:  
   TestName: testSetIdWithExtremeValues
   Description: This scenario is meant to test the setId method for edge cases, such as when an extremely large Long value for id is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the object which the setId method belongs to.
   Act: Invoke the setId method with an extremely large integer value as the id.
   Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set id value with the extra large value.
 Validation: 
   This assertion verifies that the setId method can handle and set extremely large Long values. This is significant for ensuring our function can handle all valid Long input values. 

Scenario 4: Testing the Scenario when negative Id is tested
  
  Details:  
   TestName: testSetIdWithNegativeValues
   Description: This scenario is meant to test the setId method when a negative Long value for id is provided. Although in real-world scenarios, id's are not usually negative, but it's good to test your software with all possible values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the object which the setId method belongs to.
   Act: Invoke the setId method with a negative long value.
   Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set id value with the negative value.
 Validation: 
   This assertion verifies that the setId method can handle and set negative Long values. It makes sure that our code is able to accept all long values as some databases can store negative numbers as id.
