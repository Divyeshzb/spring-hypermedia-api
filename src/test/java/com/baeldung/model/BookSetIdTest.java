================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a SQL command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: In broader context, taking user inputs and directly using them in SQL commands may leave your application open to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of concatenating user inputs into SQL commands directly. Ensure data sanitization and validation steps are included.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: Should user inputs be used directly when generating a web page, there is a risk of cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker might inject JavaScript code that will be executed on the client-side.
Solution: Ensure user inputs are properly encoded before they are displayed. Use established libraries which are specifically designed to handle such encoding. Always sanitize and validate user inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Excessive logging or error messages displayed to the user may expose sensitive information that can be leveraged by an attacker.
Solution: Ensure whatever data returned to the user or logged, doesn't contain sensitive information. Also, pay attention to the data serialized using @JsonIgnore annotation to exclude the sensitive or confidential attributes from serialization.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Setting a Valid Id
Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithValidInput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setId method functions correctly when passed a valid long integer as input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an object instance.
  Act: Call setId on the object using a valid long integer as argument.
  Assert: Check whether the object's id matches the long integer passed in the setId method.
Validation: 
  If the assertion is true, it means that the id was set correctly. This validates that the setId method can handle valid inputs as expected.

Scenario 2: Setting a Null Id
Details: 
  TestName: setIdWithNullInput
  Description: This test is meant to check how the setId method handles null inputs. Java should throw a NullPointer Exception in such a case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an object instance.
  Act: Call setId on the object using null as an argument.
  Assert: Verify that the expected exception (NullPointer) is thrown.
Validation: 
  The precondition is that the system should not accept null id's. This helps in validating that the setId method behaves as expected when passed null as an argument.

Scenario 3: Setting a Negative Id
Details: 
  TestName: setIdWithNegativeInput
  Description: This test is meant to check how the setId method handles negative inputs. By convention, id's are usually positive, so the method must handle this.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an object instance.
  Act: Call setId on the object using a negative long integer as an argument.
  Assert: Check whether the object's id matches the long integer (negative) passed to setId.
Validation: 
  If the condition passes, it means that the system allows setting id with a negative value and can handle such inputs.

Scenario 4: Resetting the Id
Details: 
  TestName: resetExistingId
  Description: This test is supposed to check whether we can reset (i.e., change the value of) an existing id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an object instance with a pre-set id.
  Act: Call setId on that object using a different long integer than the one initially set.
  Assert: Check whether the object's id has been updated to match the new long integer.
Validation: 
  If the assertion is true, it indicates that the setId method is capable of resetting an id, which is an essential feature for handling updates and changes.
