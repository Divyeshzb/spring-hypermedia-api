================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) || CWE-639
Issue: Exposing direct object references like ID publicly, if not properly validated or protected, can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
Solution: Always validate and authorize the entity access in your business logic layer. Consider using UUID instead of sequential IDs or implement another layer of reference mapping that can not be easily guessed or tampered with.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') || CWE-79
Issue: Working directly with user input, if not properly sanitized, can lead to Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) attacks enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts.
Solution: Use contextual output encoding/escaping to neutralize user-controlled input that is later presented as a web page. Ensure all user inputs are validated before use in application code.

Vulnerability: Bean Manipulation and Mass Assignment || CWE-915
Issue: A potential issue may arise from mass assignment when all bean properties are automatically bound to request parameters, possibly allowing malicious users to alter protected attributes.
Solution: Explicitly define the properties that can be mass-assigned, or use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to encapsulate the parameters for methods of an interface.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test scenario for valid id assignment

Details:  
  TestName: testValidIdAssignment
  Description: The test is meant to check if the id is successfully assigned to the entity by using the setId method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid Long id, along with the entity mock.
  Act: Invoke setId method of the entity with this id. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the id field of the entity against the originally initialized id.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the id is correctly assigned to the entity. If the id field of the entity equals the initially assigned id, it means that the setId method works as expected.

Scenario 2: Test scenario for null id assignment

Details:  
  TestName: testNullIdAssignment
  Description: This test is to check if the setId method handles null values without any error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a null Long id, along with the entity mock.
  Act: Invoke setId method of the entity with this null id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the id field of the entity is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to validate if the setId method can handle and assign null values successfully. If the id field of the entity is null, it means that the setId method properly handles and assigns null values.

Scenario 3: Test scenario for negative id assignment

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeIdAssignment
  Description: This test is to check if the setId method can handle and assign a negative id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a negative Long id, along with the entity mock.
  Act: Invoke setId method of the entity with this negative id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the id field of the entity is the initially assigned negative id.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if setId method can handle and assign negative id values successfully. If the id field of the entity equals the initially assigned negative id, it means that the setId method works properly.
