================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If setter methods like setId() are misused, they could potentially lead to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability, leading to unauthorized access to data.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive methods publicly. Always make sure that convoluted business logic and validation checks are in place to mitigate IDOR attacks.

Vulnerability: JSON Injection (CWE-74)
Issue: If data from the setId() method gets directly incorporated into a JSON response without proper output encoding or validation, it could lead to JSON injection attacks.
Solution: Ensure proper output encoding of user-controlled data when generating JSON response, along with data sanitization and validation.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: If data from the setId() method gets incorporated directly into a SQL query without appropriate safeguards, it could lead to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Avoid direct SQL queries with user-controlled data. Use PreparedStatement, ORM libraries, or similar safe methods that inherently take care of SQL Injection issues.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test setId with a positive id

Details:
  TestName: testSetIdWithPositiveId
  Description: This test is meant to check the setId method when a positive id is provided. The specific functionality under scrutiny is the correct assignment of a new id to the object.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class and prepare a positive id value.
    Act: Invoke setId with the prepared id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the current id of the object is equal to the supplied id.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the object's id can be updated correctly using the setId method. The expected result is the successful assignment of the new id, ensuring the method behaves as expected given valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Setting id to null

Details:
  TestName: testSetIdWithNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the setId method when null is provided as id. The specific functionality being tested is whether the method can handle null input without crashing and the new id is set to null.
Execution:
   Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class.
   Act: Invoke setId method with null as parameter.
   Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the current id of the object is now null.
Validation: 
   This assertion aims to validate the ability of setId to handle null values. The expected result is a successful execution without errors and the id of the object set to null. This test is significant in ensuring the method's resilience and stability against null inputs.

Scenario 3: Test setId with negative Id

Details:
  TestName: testSetIdWithNegativeId
  Description: This test is meant to check the setId method when a negative id is provided. It is expected that the setId should accept any Long value as per the method definition.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class and prepare a negative id value.
    Act: Invoke setId with the prepared id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the current id of the object is equal to the supplied id.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks if a negative id can be set without causing any exceptions or errors. The expected result is the successful assignment of the negative id. It verifies the method functionality and the ability to handle any possible Long integer values, adhering to its contract.
