================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Missing Class Definition
Issue: Without a proper class definition, we cannot evaluate the security impact of variables and methods in their proper context.
Solution: Include the complete class definition, with variables and methods, in the script.

Vulnerability: Instantiation With Potentially Unsafe Values
Issue: An object of Book is being instantiated with string parameters which, if sourced from untrusted data, can lead to potential injection attacks.
Solution: Use proper input validation or sanitization before using it for object instantiation. Leverage encoding strategies, if necessary.

Vulnerability: Inappropriate Import of Unused Libraries
Issue: Importing unused libraries can invite unnecessary risks and unoptimized code.
Solution: Import only the necessary libraries and remove all unused imports.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Normal valid inputs
Details:  
TestName: testBookCreationWithValidInputs
Description: This test is meant to check the Book constructor by passing all required parameters in a valid format in order to ensure if the Book object can be successfully created.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare String variables "author", "title" and "isbn".
Act: Call the Book constructor with the prepared variables.
Assert: Validate that the created book object is not null. Use getters to check each field.
Validation: 
This test case verifies that the Book object can be successfully initialized with normal valid inputs, and all the provided fields are correctly set up. This is critical for the application's data consistency.

Scenario 2: Invalid author input
Details:  
TestName: testBookCreationWithInvalidAuthor
Description: This test is meant to check the Book constructor by passing an unformatted author name to check if any form of error handling is set up to prevent the creation of such Books.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare String variables "author" (with improper format), "title" and "isbn".
Act: Call the Book constructor with the prepared variables.
Assert: Check if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
This test case verifies if the application has implemented error handling when an unformatted author name is provided.

Scenario 3: Null inputs
Details:  
TestName: testBookCreationWithNullInputs
Description: This test is meant to check the Book constructor by passing null for all parameters to check if any form of error handling is set up to prevent the creation of such Books.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare null values for String variables "author", "title" and "isbn".
Act: Call the Book constructor with the prepared null variables.
Assert: Check if a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
This test case verifies if the application throws an exception when null inputs are provided, ensuring that no books with null fields can be created, maintaining data consistency.

Scenario 4: Empty string inputs
Details:  
TestName: testBookCreationWithEmptyStringInputs
Description: This test is meant to check the Book constructor by passing empty strings for all parameters to check if any form of error handling is set up to prevent the creation of such Books.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare empty strings for "author", "title" and "isbn".
Act: Call the Book constructor with the prepared empty strings.
Assert: Check if an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
This test case verifies if the application throws an exception when empty strings are provided, avoiding books with empty fields, which could influence data consistency.
