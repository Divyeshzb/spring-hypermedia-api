================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure (CWE-200 / CWE-209)
Issue: The setAuthor method appears to directly set the author property without validating the input. If this property contains sensitive data, injection attacks could occur. Moreover, in a larger context if this class is an entity in a Spring boot application, JSON Views from Jackson library (imported in provided code) might not always suffice to prevent sensitive data from being serialized and leaked.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize input to setter methods to prevent potential injection attacks, and consider using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) instead of directly exposing entity classes in your API endpoints. This adds an extra layer of abstraction which can help prevent sensitive data from being exposed.

"""
Scenario 1: Standard Author Name Test

Details:  
  TestName: setGivenAuthorName
  Description: The test will verify whether the given author name is correctly getting set. A valid author name will be used for this test. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class containing the setAuthor method and define a valid author name. 
  Act: Call setAuthor method with the valid author name. 
  Assert: Use getter method getAuthor() to fetch the author's name and compare with initially set author name.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the author's name has been set correctly. If the setAuthor functionality works correctly, the name it retrieves through getAuthor should match the name set by setAuthor.
-----
Scenario 2: Null Author Name Test

Details:  
  TestName: setNullAuthorName
  Description: The test will check the behavior of the setAuthor method when null is passed as an argument. This test will ensure that the method handles null inputs without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class containing the method and set the author name as null.
  Act: Call the method setAuthor with null. 
  Assert: Use the getAuthor method to confirm that the author's name is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks if null value can be set as an author name without any exceptions. The getAuthor method should return null if setAuthor correctly handles null inputs. 
-----
Scenario 3: Empty String Author Name Test

Details:  
  TestName: setEmptyAuthorName
  Description: This test will validate the behavior of the setAuthor method when an empty string is passed as a parameter. The aim is to ensure the function handles empty strings without failing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an instance of the class and define the author name as an empty string.
  Act: Execute the method setAuthor with an empty string.
  Assert: Use getAuthor() to affirm that the author's name is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The test checks whether an empty string can be set as an author's name without issues. If setAuthor properly deals with empty string inputs, the fetched author name using getAuthor should be an empty string.
-----
Scenario 4: Special Characters Author Name Test

Details: 
  TestName: setAuthorNameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test is supposed to identify if setAuthor can handle author names containing special characters. It's a critical test to confirm the flexibility and robustness of the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set an author name containing special characters.
  Act: Invoke the method setAuthor with the specially characterized author name.
  Assert: Verify the author's name by using getAuthor() to ensure it matches the special character name given.
Validation: 
  This test is designed to verify if the function can cope with names having special characters. The author name fetched via getAuthor should match with the special character name if the setAuthor can handle such inputs.
