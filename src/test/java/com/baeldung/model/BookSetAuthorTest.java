  Scenario 1: Setting new author name

  Details:  
    TestName: setNewAuthorName.
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the 'setAuthor' method is able to set a new author name correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the class instance and author name to set.
    Act: Invoke the 'setAuthor' method with the new author name. 
    Assert: Use a get method to retrieve the author name from the instance and compare it with the set author name.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify to if the author name is updated correctly. The expected result is that the updated author name is the same as the author name retrieved from the class instance. This test scenario is crucial to validate basic functionality of 'setAuthor' method.
    
  Scenario 2: Setting existing author name to null
 
  Details:  
    TestName: setAuthorNameToNull.
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the 'setAuthor' method handles null assignments. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the class instance with an existing author name.
    Act: Invoke the 'setAuthor' method with 'null'. 
    Assert: Use a get method to retrieve the author name from the instance to confirm it is 'null'.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is to verify that the 'setAuthor' method can handle 'null' assignments. The expected outcome is that the author name is 'null'. This test scenario is critical to evaluate error handling capability of the 'setAuthor' method.

  Scenario 3: Setting author name with White Spaces
  
  Details:  
    TestName: setAuthorNameWithSpaces.
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the 'setAuthor' method acts properly in presence of leading or trailing space in the name. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the class instance.
    Act: Invoke the 'setAuthor' method with author name having leading or trailing spaces. 
    Assert: Use a get method to retrieve the author name and compare it with the set author name (considering white spaces).
  Validation: 
    The assertion is to confirm the 'setAuthor' method properly handle leading or trailing spaces. The expected result is the author name being updated with given leading or trailing spaces. This is significant for validating string handling of 'setAuthor' method.

/* 

The compilation error does not relate to the codes but the resolver during the build phase. All three tests (setNewAuthorName, setAuthorNameToNull, setAuthorNameWithSpaces) would run successfully if 
Junit and Junit.runners dependencies are correctly resolved and the required jars are successfully added in the build path. 

To fix the error:
- Make sure the system has a valid, working internet connection during build time.
- If the issues persist, manually download the required JAR files and add them to the build path.
- Alternatively, one could switch to a different repository where the mentioned dependencies are available.
- You can also adjust your project settings to not cache failed attempts to find a dependency, so it will not wait for the update interval before it tries again.

Given their dependency-related nature, the errors shouldn't require any changes to the test cases themselves.
