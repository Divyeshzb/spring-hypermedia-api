================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Misuse of Jackson Library - CWE-502
Issue: Use of Jackson Library without properly implemented access controls can lead to cases of arbitrary object deserialization which increases the risk of remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure access controls are integrated and enable default typing only for a whitelist of classes. Make sure to update the Jackson-Databind dependency to version 2.9.10.1 or later, which contains fixes for some known exploitation vectors.

Vulnerability: Insecure Data Exposure - CWE-200
Issue: From the provided code snippet, it is not clear if data handling policies are implemented correctly. There can be risks associated with data leakage if sensitive data is stored in @Entity objects without proper security controls.
Solution: Ensure all sensitive data fields in @Entity model classes come with the @JsonIgnore annotation and no getter methods. Use @JsonView to control serialization. Store sensitive data in a secure manner, make use of proper encrypting libraries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Normal Scenario for setting an author
Details:  
    TestName: setAuthorWithValidName.
    Description: This test checks the setAuthor method by passing a valid String as the author's name. This is a sunny-day scenario, meant to test basic, expected functionality
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a String representing the author's name.
    Act: Call setAuthor() with the created String.
    Assert: Confirm that getAuthor() returns the same value that was passed to setAuthor().
  Validation: 
    The assertion is verifying that the setAuthor method correctly stores the passed value. The expected result is positive because this is how a setter method is supposed to work. The test ensures that the class can store the author name correctly. 

Scenario 2: Null input to setAuthor
Details:  
    TestName: setAuthorWithNullName.
    Description: This test checks the setAuthor method by passing a null value, which may lead to unwanted behavior if not handled correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup needed.
    Act: Call setAuthor() with a null.
    Assert: Confirm that getAuthor() returns either null or a default value, depending on the implementation.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is checking the behavior when null is passed. The expected result is based on the principle of robustness, which requires that the system continues to operate even under abnormal inputs.

Scenario 3: Long Author Name
Details:  
    TestName: setAuthorWithLongName.
    Description: This test looks at how the setAuthor function reacts when given an extremely long string as an input. It is intended to explore how the method handles edge cases.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an extremely long string.
    Act: Call setAuthor() with the long string.
    Assert: Confirm that getAuthor() returns the same value, or confirm that an error of some sort is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the setAuthor method can handle unusually long author names. The expected result depends on the desired behavior of the system. This test ensures the system can handle edge cases and prevent potential issues with storage and rendering.

Scenario 4: Empty String
Details:  
    TestName: setAuthorWithEmptyString.
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the setAuthor method when the string is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup needed.
    Act: Call setAuthor() with an empty string.
    Assert: Confirm that getAuthor() returns an empty string or some form of default value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ascertains that the method correctly handles an empty string, whether it chooses to accept it or default to another value. This test ensures potential issues with empty strings are handled.
