================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The JsonIgnore annotation can lead to exposure of sensitive data if not used cautiously. Never use it on fields like password, SSN, etc.
Solution: Ensure you do not ignore sensitive fields unintentionally. If necessary, use defensive programming practices.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The lack of encryption when dealing with sensitive data can lead to information leakage.
Solution: Always use encryption techniques (preferably strong-ones such as AES, RSA, etc.) when dealing with sensitive data. Never store passwords and similar sensitive data in plain format.

Vulnerability: CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
Issue: When dealing with file I/O operations, using relative paths may expose vulnerability to path traversal attacks.
Solution: Use absolute paths and sanitize input paths when dealing with file I/O in Java.

Vulnerability: CWE-338: Weak PRNG
Issue: @GeneratedValue might use weak PRNG under the hood.
Solution: Verify and use secure PRNG when dealing with operations which require random number generation. Java provides SecureRandom class for this purpose.

""" 
Scenario 1: Test to check if getId method is returning the correct value.

Details:  
  TestName: testCorrectIdReturning.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getId method, specifically to ensure it is returning the correct ID value which is present in the database. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the 'id' variable with a known value for the specific entity.
  Act: Invoke the getId method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the known 'id' value.
Validation: 
  We are aiming to verify if the getId method is returning the correct value from the entity. The known 'id' value and the returned value from the method must be the same. Here, the significance of the test lies in verifying the correct functionality of the getId method.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getId method returns null when no ID is assigned.

Details:  
  TestName: testNullReturnWhenNoId.
  Description: This test is intended to check if the getId method returns null when no ID is assigned to the entity. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set any 'id' value for the entity.
  Act: Invoke the getId method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  This assertion is to verify that the getId method will return null when no 'id' value is available in the entity. The method should ideally return null in such scenarios since there's no 'id' assigned.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getId method is thread-safe.

Details:  
  TestName: testIdThreadSafety.
  Description: This test is to check the thread-safety of the getId method. This becomes important in multi-threaded scenarios or while handling concurrent requests. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple threads and in each thread, get the 'id' value of the entity.
  Act: Start all the threads. 
  Assert: At the end, verify that all the threads have received the correct 'id' value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify the thread safety of the method. This test is important as it verifies that the method works accurately even in a multi-threaded environment.
