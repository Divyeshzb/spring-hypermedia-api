================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getId() method can potentially expose sensitive information as it might be revealing internal object identifiers. Exposing such details can provide an attacker with additional information, which could be exploited in further attacks.
Solution: Consider the actual need for exposing IDs and evaluate potential risks of doing so. If there's no need to expose the ID to the user, then it should be marked with @JsonIgnore to avoid serialization into JSON.

Vulnerability: CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG
Issue: The ID generation mechanism is not clear in the submitted code. Using a predictable ID generation mechanism can lead to unauthorized data access in various scenarios.
Solution: If IDs are generated in a predictable manner, you should use cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNG) for generating IDs. Also, ensure that IDs are not sequentially incrementing, as this could be easily guessed and exploited by an attacker.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The provided code does not offer evidence of proper least privilege practices. Exposure of resources without explicit access control can give potential attackers unauthorized access.
Solution: Make sure that you follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP). Every user, process and system should have the minimum necessary privileges to perform their function. This may require defining specific roles and permissions in your application.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the Return Null Id 
Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnNull()
  Description: This test will check if the getId() method returns null when no ID has been set. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no id is initialized.
    Act: Call the getId() method.
    Assert: AssertNull on the result of getId(). 
  Validation: 
   The assertion aims to verify if getId() returns null when no Id has been set. In the context of application behaviour, it is significant to verify that the getId() method can handle null cases gracefully.

Scenario 2: Testing the Return of Non-Null Id
Details: 
  TestName: testGetIdReturnNonNull()
  Description: This test will check if the getId() method is able to return a previously set ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the id field with a non-null Long value.
    Act: Call the getId() method.
    Assert: AssertEquals on the expected id and the result of getId(). 
  Validation: 
    The validation is to verify if getId() correctly retrieves the set id. In terms of application logic, it is important to ensure correct retrieval of Id for successful operations.

Scenario 3: Testing the Return of Zero as Id
Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnZero()
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the getId() method is able to account for scenarios where the id assigned is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the id field with zero.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method.
    Assert: AssertEquals on the expected zero id and the result of getId().
  Validation: 
    The validation is to make sure if getId() handles the assignment of zero to an Id correctly. This is significant for application logic as it may deal with operations where Id could be zero.
