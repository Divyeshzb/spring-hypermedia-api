================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Leakage Through Log Files
Issue: Data leakage can occur when sensitive information is logged, leaving it accessible in log files.
Solution: Review the logging settings and do not log sensitive data. Also, consider using a logging library that explicitly excludes the logging of sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-378: Use of Outdated Third-Party Libraries
Issue: The risk of having a vulnerability that is already known and possibly being exploited increases if outdated libraries are used.
Solution: Regularly update third-party libraries to their latest secure versions. Setting up automatic dependency updates can help reduce the risk.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: Weak random number generators can lead to predictability in session cookies, tokens, and other security-critical elements.
Solution: Use secure randomizers like java.security.SecureRandom class instead of java.util.Random for generating random values in security-sensitive contexts.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: Insecure handling of database queries can lead to SQL Injection.
Solution: Always make sure to use parameterized queries or employ an ORM that can guard against SQL Injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: Deserializing untrusted data can lead to remote code execution.
Solution: If possible, avoid deserialization of untrusted data. Use safe alternatives such as using JSON or XML to parse and generate data.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method correctly returns the ID
Details:  
  TestName: getIdReturnsCorrectId
  Description: This test checks if the method getId() returns the correct value of the private field 'id'. This is essential to ensure that the correct id is retrieved when called upon in different parts of the program. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the class with the getId method is created, with a defined 'id'. 
    Act: Invoke the getId method of the instance.
    Assert: Verify if the returned value matches the 'id' value set in the Arrange step.
  Validation: 
    This assertion ensures that the getId method correctly returns the 'id' of the instance. This is important because it forms the basis of object identification in database operations and other aspects of the app.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns null when 'id' is not set
Details:  
  TestName: getIdReturnsNullIfIdNotSet
  Description: This test checks if the method getId() returns null when the 'id' field has not been set. This scenario could occur when a new instance is created but the 'id' has not been initialized yet. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: A new instance of the class with the getId method is created, but 'id' is not defined.
    Act: Invoke the getId method of the instance.
    Assert: Confirm if the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the getId() method correctly handles situations where 'id' has not been initialized, returning null instead of causing a NullReferenceException. This is key for robust error handling in the app.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns the last set value of 'id'
Details:  
  TestName: getIdReturnsLastSetValue
  Description: This test ensures that getId() returns the most recent value set to 'id' in scenarios where 'id' changes. This ensures that the state of the object is properly maintained and updated across the app.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the class with the getId method is created. The 'id' value is set, then changed to a new value.
    Act: Invoke the getId method of the instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value corresponds to the last set 'id' value.
  Validation: 
    This assertion ensures accurate state management and data consistency in the app by confirming that the most recent 'id' value is always returned by getId().
