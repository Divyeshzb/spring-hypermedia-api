================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unfiltered input or CWE-20
Issue: If inputs to the application aren't being validated or sanitized before use, it may lead to various security vulnerabilities like SQL-Injection, XSS, RCE etc.
Solution: Use input validation techniques before using user-provided inputs anywhere in your application. Libraries like Apache Commons Validator can come handy.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling or CWE-209
Issue: If application errors expose sensitive information, it might lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure that the errors shown to the users do not expose any sensitive information. Consider using custom error pages.

Vulnerability: Security misconfiguration or CWE-933
Issue: If third-party libraries (such as Jackson or Hibernate in your case) are not configured securely or they are outdated, they might introduce vulnerabilities in your application.
Solution: Keep your libraries up-to-date and follow their documentation to ensure secure configuration.
