================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: If the getAuthor() method allows direct access to sensitive data fields, it may pose a risk of IDOR. Attackers could manipulate references to access unauthorized data.
Solution: Implement access controls or use lookup methods that require passing an additional access control parameter.

Vulnerability: XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) or CWE-79
Issue: If the data returned by getAuthor() is used and rendered directly in the UI without proper sanitization, it may lead to XSS attacks, where malicious scripts could be injected.
Solution: Validate, sanitize, and escape any user-supplied input and data from the database before its use in the UI layer. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP), escape special characters before displaying in UI.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection or CWE-89
Issue: If author data is used to construct SQL queries, it can potentially cause SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries or stored procedures instead of concatenating user supplied input or database data within SQL queries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to Make Sure the getAuthor Method Returns the Correct Author

Details:
  TestName: testGetAuthorReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test will check if the getAuthor method is returning the expected author's name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: An author's name is assigned to the 'author' variable.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: The result will be compared with the expected author's name.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAuthor method is functioning correctly, returning the value that it is supposed to. This is significant in ensuring that accurate information about the author is provided when required.

Scenario 2: Test to Check for Empty Author Strings

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyAuthorValue
  Description: The purpose of this test is to determine how the getAuthor method responds when the 'author' variable contains an empty string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty string is assigned to the 'author' variable.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: It is confirmed that an empty string is returned by the getAuthor method.
Validation: 
  This assertion is intended to ensure that the method correctly handles empty string values and does not result in unexpected behavior or errors. This is vital to ensure application stability in case of missing author data.

Scenario 3: Test to Check Response for Null Author Value

Details:
  TestName: testNullAuthorValue
  Description: The objective of this test is to ascertain what the getAuthor method returns when the 'author' variable is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Null is assigned to the 'author' variable.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Verify that null is returned by the getAuthor method.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks if method properly handles null values. Ensuring method's correct handling of null values is critical to prevent null pointer exceptions while executing the application. 

Scenario 4: Test for Handling Large Author Strings

Details:
  TestName: testLargeAuthorStringValue
  Description: This test aims to validate whether getAuthor method handles large string values without throwing an exception. 
Execution:
  Arrange: A very large string is assigned to the 'author' variable.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: The result should not throw an out of memory exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the method can handle large string values. This is crucial in instances where author names or inputs can be extraordinarily large.
