================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-338: Weak PRNG
Issue: In your code, you create a random ISBN for a book. If the 'isbn' is predictable or can be controlled by an attacker, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
Solution: Consider using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) instead of just a random function.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Your code does not perform any validation checks on the 'isbn' setter function. This could allow an attacker to pass in script content or SQL commands, enabling cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Solution: Consider implementing an input validation method for the 'isbn'. This will ensure that the values provided by the user (or other sources) are valid before using them.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: A method for setting ISBN is public, this may expose sensitive book information.
Solution: Rethink the access level for the method and consider not exposing these sensitive methods to entities that should not have access.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The 'isbn' could be considered sensitive information, depending on the context. Its exposure, even if done unintentionally, could lead to privacy violations.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information such as this is properly protected from unauthorized access, using appropriate access control mechanisms.

"""
  Scenario 1: Valid ISBN
  Details:
    TestName: setIsbnWithValidData
    Description: This test will validate if the method correctly sets the ISBN when provided with a valid ISBN string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is needed as there's no dependency for this test.
    Act: Invoke the setIsbn method with a valid ISBN.
    Assert: Assert that the object's ISBN has been updated to the new ISBN.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that a valid ISBN is successfully set by the method. The expected result is that the object's ISBN should match the ISBN we passed to the method.

  Scenario 2: Null ISBN
  Details:
    TestName: setIsbnWithNull
    Description: This test will check if the method is handling null values gracefully.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: No setup is needed as there's no dependency for this test.
    Act: Invoke the setIsbn method with a null ISBN.
    Assert: Assert that the object's ISBN is null.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the method can handle null inputs gracefully. The expected result is that the object's ISBN should be null.

  Scenario 3: Empty ISBN
  Details:
    TestName: setIsbnWithEmptyString
    Description: This test will check if the method is handling empty string ISBNs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is needed as there's no dependency for this test.
    Act: Invoke the setIsbn method with an empty string.
    Assert: Assert that the object's ISBN is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the method can handle empty string inputs. The expected result is that the object's ISBN should be an empty string.

  Scenario 4: ISBN with White Spaces
  Details:
    TestName: setIsbnWithWhiteSpaces
    Description: This test will check if the method is handling ISBNs containing white spaces.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is needed as there's no dependency for this test.
    Act: Invoke the setIsbn method with a string containing white spaces.
    Assert: Assert that the object's ISBN is the string with white spaces.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the method can handle white spaces in the ISBN. The expected result is that the object's ISBN should match the string containing white spaces.
