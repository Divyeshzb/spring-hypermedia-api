================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Exposure of Sensitive Information CWE-200
Issue: Any unmanaged resources or debugging information could potentially leak sensitive information either in the form of debug info or in the form of saved unencrypted data.
Solution: Ensure all resources are properly managed and no sensitive info is leaked in the form of debug information or unencrypted data.

Vulnerability: Improper Encryption or Hashing CWE-326
Issue: Any data that is kept unencrypted or hashed improperly can be read by attackers which could lead to serious repercussions.
Solution: Implement proper encryption measures for data storage and transmission as a part of secure coding practices.

Vulnerability: Injection Attack CWE-77, CWE-89
Issue: If unvalidated user input is allowed to modify control flow or data flow, an attacker can inject malicious code to gain access or disrupt system operations.
Solution: Use validation of user input to prevent formation of unintended command or code sequences. Always use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Vulnerability: Missing Data Access Controls CWE-284
Issue: Without adequate data access controls in place, unauthorized individuals might gain access to sensitive data.
Solution: Proper access controls must be implemented to restrict access to sensitive information based on user roles or permissions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check the assignment of the title field in normal circumstances
Details:  
  TestName: testSetTitleWithValidString
  Description: This test is meant to check the normal working of the setTitle method. The purpose is to ensure that the title field of the object is correctly updated when called with a valid string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class with the setTitle method. Define a valid String for setting the title.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the prepared string parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the updated title field of the object with the expected result, which would be the same as the input string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion will confirm that the setTitle method is working correctly when a valid string is passed. Itâ€™s important as it ensures the string assignment is working properly within the application logic.

Scenario 2: Passing null as parameter for setTitle method
Details:
  TestName: testSetTitleWithNullValue
  Description: This test is designed to validate the behavior of the setTitle method when it is called with a null parameter. This is a crucial scenario to ensure the system can handle null pointers appropriately.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class and a null string.
    Act: Call the setTitle method passing the null string as a parameter.
    Assert: Check if the title field of the object is now null, as expected.
  Validation: 
    The assertion should verify the capability of the setTitle method to assign null to the title field. This is significant for validating application stability and resilience to NullPointerException.

Scenario 3: Test to validate title assignment with an empty string
Details:
  TestName: testSetTitleWithEmptyString
  Description: This test verifies if the setTitle method correctly assigns an empty string as the title field. This is a fundamental case that checks the handling of empty strings by the method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class and an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the empty string.
    Assert: Check if the title field of the object has been updated to an empty string.
  Validation: 
    It's important to ensure that the method can correctly handle and assign the title field as an empty string without any unexpected behavior. No exceptions should be thrown.
