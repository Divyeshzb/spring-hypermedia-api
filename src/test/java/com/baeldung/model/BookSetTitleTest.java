================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Incomplete or inefficient use of Annotations for Entity
Issue: A possible vulnerability could originate from incorrect or incomplete use of annotations for defining entities in JPA. It could lead to various issues, such as inefficient database operations such as unindexed columns, unexpected cascades, etc.
Solution: Ensure you provide complete and correct use of JPA annotations which includes @Entity, @Id, @GeneratedValue for your entity class and other necessary elements for table mapping.

Vulnerability: Insecure object binding (CWE-502)
Issue: The use of Jackson's annotation @JsonView could potentially lead to Insecure Direct Object Reference(IDOR) vulnerabilities resulting in unauthorized data exposure and modification if not handled properly.
Solution: Review your code for correct usage of @JsonView. Use input validation or context-based access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized data is bound to your views.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
Issue: Use of @JsonIgnore without proper thinking might lead to sensitive data exposure.
Solution: Review your code and use @JsonIgnore cautiously. Make sure you do not ignore any fields/data that are required and also you do not expose any sensitive data unintentionally. Use additional security measures like encryption for sensitive data fields.

"""
Scenario 1: Valid Title Input
  Details:  
    TestName: setTitleWithValidInput
    Description: This test checks that the setTitle method works correctly with a valid String as a parameter, setting the title of the respective object accordingly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and a valid String title as input. 
    Act: Invoke setTitle with the valid String as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title of the object was indeed set to the provided String value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion needs to verify that the object's getTitle() method returns the same String as what was passed into setTitle. If valid, this ensures that the setTitle method effectively sets the title of the object to the expected value.

Scenario 2: Null Title Input
  Details:  
    TestName: setTitleWithNullInput
    Description: This test checks how the setTitle method handles a null input, expecting it to set the title of the object to null as it doesn't check for null values explicitly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and a null String title as input.
    Act: Invoke setTitle with the null String as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title of the object was set to null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion should verify that the object's getTitle() method returns null. This checks for the robustness of the setTitle() method, by ensuring it doesn't crash with null values.

Scenario 3: Empty Title Input
  Details:  
    TestName: setTitleWithEmptyInput
    Description: This test checks how the setTitle method handles an empty String as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and an empty String("") as a title input.
    Act: Invoke setTitle with the empty String as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title of the object was set to be an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion needs to confirm that the object's getTitle() method returns an empty string. This checks for the robustness of the setTitle() method, by ensuring it validly handles empty strings as input. 

Scenario 4: Long Title Input
  Details:  
    TestName: setTitleWithLongInput
    Description: This test is for checking the boundary conditions where the setTitle method handles a string of maximum length as the input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and a very long String as the title input.
    Act: Invoke setTitle with the very long String as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title of the object was set to the long string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion should verify that the object's getTitle() method returns the long string that was passed into setTitle. This checks how well the method handles large amounts of data.
