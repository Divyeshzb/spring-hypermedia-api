================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation - CWE-20
Issue: If the value of 'title' is used in SQL queries or shell commands without proper validation, it can lead to injection attacks, including SQL injection and shell injection.
Solution: Ensure that every user input is properly validated and sanitized before it is used in SQL queries, shell commands, or other critical functions. Avoid constructing queries or commands dynamically using user inputs.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: setTitle with Valid Input
  Details:  
    TestName: setTitleWithValidInput
    Description: The test is meant to check if the title is properly set when a valid input is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup or mocks required. 
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with a valid string parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title has been set to the provided value. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the title has been correctly set in response to a valid input. The significance of the test is to ensure the method correctly responds to normal usage.

  Scenario 2: setTitle with Empty String
  Details:  
    TestName: setTitleWithEmptyInput
    Description: This test checks the behavior of setTitle when it's called with an empty string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup or mocks required. 
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with an empty string. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title has been set to an empty string. 
  Validation: 
    The test aims to verify the behavior of the setTitle method when it receives an empty string. This contributes to understanding the method's response to unusual but not necessarily incorrect inputs.

  Scenario 3: setTitle with Null Input
  Details:  
    TestName: setTitleWithNullInput
    Description: This test verifies how the setTitle method handles null inputs. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup or mocks required. 
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with a null parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if title has been set to null.
  Validation: 
    The test verifies the behavior of the setTitle method when provided a null input. This validates how the method handles potentially unexpected or error-related use-cases.

  Scenario 4: setTitle with extremely long string input
  Details:  
    TestName: setTitleWithLongStringInput
    Description: This test aims to understand the behavior of the setTitle method when the input is an extremely long string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup or mocks required. 
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with a long string. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title has been set to the long string. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies the setTitle function's capability to handle extreme case inputs and maintain data integrity.
