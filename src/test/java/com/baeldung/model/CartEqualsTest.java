================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-597: Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison
Issue: In Java, string comparison using '==' checks the reference equality, meaning it checks whether both strings are pointing to the same object, rather than their actual contents. If different string objects with the same contents are compared, the result will be false unexpectedly.
Solution: Always use .equals() method for string comparison. This method checks the actual contents of the string.

Vulnerability: CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
Issue: Using '==' to check for boolean equality is error-prone. Again, '==' checks references, not values.
Solution: Use the Boolean.equals() method to compare boolean values to avoid errors.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: When 'books' or 'other.books' are null, calling .equals() on them will result in a NullPointerException.
Solution: Always perform null checks before dereferencing objects. Consider using java.util.Objects.equals() which handles nulls gracefully.

"""
Scenario 1: Same object comparison test

Details:  
  TestName: sameObjectComparisonTest
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the same object is passed to compare which should return true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and pass the same object in equals method.
    Act: Call the equals method.
    Assert: The expected result is true since both are same object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when the same object is being used for comparison.
    This test is important as it verifies the correct behavior when comparing an instance with itself.

Scenario 2: Different class object comparison

Details:  
  TestName: differentClassObjectComparisonTest
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when a different class object is passed to compare which should return false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of a different class and pass it to the equals method.
    Act: Call the equals method.
    Assert: The expected result is false because both objects belong to a different data type.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that equals method correctly identifies that the object belongs to a different class.
    This test is important as it verifies correct behavior when an incompatible class's instance is used for comparison.

Scenario 3: Null object comparison

Details:  
  TestName: nullObjectComparisonTest
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when a null object is passed to compare, which should return false. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a null object to the equals method.
    Act: Call the equals method.
    Assert: The expected result is false because null can't be equal to any instance of the Cart class.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when a null object is passed.
    This test is important as it verifies the correct behavior when a null object is used for comparison. 

Scenario 4: Different object attribute comparison

Details:  
  TestName: differentObjectAttributeComparisonTest
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when an object with different attributes is passed to compare, which should return false. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a cart object with different attributes and pass it to the equals method.
    Act: Call the equals method.
    Assert: The expected result is false because the attributes of the objects are different.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the equals method works correctly when two different objects with different attributes are compared. 
    This test is significant as it verifies the correct behavior when comparing two different objects with different attributes.

Scenario 5: Same object attribute comparison test

Details:  
  TestName: sameObjectAttributeComparisonTest
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when an object with the same attributes is passed to compare which should return true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a cart object with the same attributes and pass it to the equals method.
    Act: Call the equals method.
    Assert: The expected result is true because the attributes of the objects are equal.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two objects have identical attributes.
    This test is important as it verifies the correct behaviour when comparing two objects with the same attributes.
