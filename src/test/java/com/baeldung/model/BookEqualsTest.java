================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unsecure Object Equality Check (CWE-595)
Issue: An unchecked typecasting in `equals(Object obj)` method which might raise a `ClassCastException`. The condition `if (getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;` does not secure the type casting because not all objects passed will be Books or subclass of Book.
Solution: Use `instanceof` operator for type checking before typecasting, and make corresponding adjustments in your equality checks.

Vulnerability: Potential Null-Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)
Issue: The code assumes 'author', 'isbn', and 'title' will not be null when calling `.equals()` method leading to potential Null-Pointer Dereference.
Solution: Include null-checks before the `.equals()` method, or use java.util.Objects.equals() method to avoid null pointer dereference.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test for equal objects
  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualObjects
    Description: This test is meant to check whether two objects which are identical (they are the same) are detected as being equals by the method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Book object and set it to another Book object.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on the first Book object using the second Book object as parameter. 
    Assert: Assert that the method returns true, since the objects are the same.
  Validation: 
    If two objects are the same, they are certainly equals. This validation is important to ensure basic principles of equality are respected by the equals() method.

  Scenario 2: Test for different class objects
  Details:  
    TestName: testDifferentClassObjects
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two objects that are not Book objects to be unequal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string object and a Book object.
    Act: Invoke equals method on the Book object with the string object as the argument.
    Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
  Validation:
    If two objects are instances of different classes, they are considered not equals. This test ensures that the equals() function correctly follows this principle.

  Scenario 3: Test for objects with different authors
  Details:  
    TestName: testDifferentAuthors
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two Book objects with different authors as not equals.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Book objects, one with author 'Author1' and one with author 'Author2'.
    Act: Invoke equals method on the first book object using the second book object as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
  Validation: 
    If two Book objects have different authors, they can't be considered equals. This test ensures that the equals() method takes into account author information when deciding if two Books are equals.

  Scenario 4: Test for objects with different ISBN
  Details:  
    TestName: testDifferentISBN
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two Book objects with different ISBNs as not equals.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Book objects, one with ISBN '1234567890' and one with ISBN '0987654321'.
    Act: Invoke equals method on the first book object using the second book object as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
  Validation: 
    If two Book objects have different ISBN, they can't be considered equals. This ensures that the equals() method takes into account ISBN when deciding if two Books are equals.

  Scenario 5: Test for objects with different titles
  Details:  
    TestName: testDifferentTitles
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two Book objects with different titles as not equals.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Book objects, one with title 'Title1' and one with title 'Title2'.
    Act: Invoke equals method on the first book object using the second book object as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
  Validation: 
    If two Book objects have different titles, they can't be considered equals. This ensures that the equals() method takes into account titles when deciding if two Books are equals.

  Scenario 6: Test for Null parameter
  Details:  
    TestName: testNullParameter
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly returns false when the argument passed is a null object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Book object.
    Act: Invoke equals method on the book object using null as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
  Validation: 
    Null references can't be equals to any object, so returning false is the expected behavior as per equals() contract.

  Scenario 7: Test for objects with null values
  Details:  
    TestName: testNullValueObjects
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly acknowledges two objects with null values as equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Book objects with null values in any of their members.
    Act: Invoke equals method on the first object using the second book object as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
  Validation: 
    If two Book objects have null values in the same members, they should still be considered equals. This test ensures that the equals() method handles null values properly.
