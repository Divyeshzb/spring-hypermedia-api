================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Disclosure - Error Messages (CWE-209)
Issue: Equal method might lead to unintended comparison failures causing unexpected behaviors and possible informative error messages that could disclose sensitive information when stack traces are printed.
Solution: Handle NullPointerExceptions properly to avoid Information Disclosure through error messages. Use optional checks or null checks before executing operations on objects.

Vulnerability: Insecure Object Equality Check (CWE-597)
Issue: Use of '==' or '!=', if used inaccurately, might lead to logically incorrect program behavior. This can lead to potential application security issues like bypassing authentication or unconditional access.
Solution: Use 'equals()' method instead of '==' operator for object equivalence check (for non-primitive types). This adheres with the Java specification and ensures objects are compared correctly based on their values rather than references.

Vulnerability: Improper use of an Object's hashCode value (CWE-780)
Issue: Although not a direct issue in the submitted code, the improper implementation of hashCode() can lead to performance issues and denial of service attacks when used in combinations with data structures like Hashmap, Hashtable, etc.
Solution: While implementing equals method, make sure you override the hashCode method as well in a way that if two objects are equal, they should return the same hash code if the objects are used in hash consumable data structures.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation CWE-20
Issue: While the equals method will handle null inputs, it does not properly validate other potential unexpected inputs that are not instance of `Book`.
Solution: Add explicit checks for validating and ensuring that the comparator object is of instance `Book` before casting, to avoid ClassCastException which can be a potential vulnerability.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing for equality with the same book object.

Details:
TestName: equalForSameObject
Description: This test covers the scenario where we are comparing the book object with its own reference, the return should always be true.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a book object.
Act: Invoke the equals() method, comparing the book to itself.
Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
The test verifies that an object is always equal to itself. This is important for consistent application behavior.

---
  
Scenario 2: Testing for equality with different book objects having the same attribute values.

Details:
TestName: equalForSameAttributeValues
Description: This test covers the scenario where we compare two different book objects having the same attribute values, the return should be true.
Execution: 
Arrange: Create two book objects with the same attribute values.
Act: Invoke the equals() method, comparing the two book objects.
Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
The test verifies that two objects with identical attributes are considered equal, as determined by the equals method's implementation. This is crucial for identifying similar objects in different application contexts.

---

Scenario 3: Testing for equality with different book objects having different attribute values.

Details:
TestName: notEqualForDifferentAttributeValues
Description: This test checks the scenario where we have two different book objects with different attribute values, the return should be false.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two book objects, each with unique attribute values.
Act: Invoke the equals() method, comparing the two book objects.
Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
The test confirms that two objects with different attributes are not considered equal. This is key to distinguishing unique objects in the application.

---

Scenario 4: Testing for equality when comparing a book object to null.

Details:
TestName: notEqualWhenComparedToNull
Description: This test verifies the scenario where a book object is compared with null, the return should be false.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a book object.
Act: Invoke the equals() method, comparing the book object to null.
Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
The test confirms that no object is equal to null. This is a standard rule used in the equals method to avoid NullPointerExceptions.

---

Scenario 5: Testing for equality with objects of different classes.

Details:
TestName: notEqualForDifferentClassObjects
Description: This test covers the scenario where we compare a book object with an object of a different class, the return should be false.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a book object and an object of a different class.
Act: Invoke the equals() method, comparing the book object to the other object.
Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
The test verifies that objects of different classes are not considered equal. This maintains data integrity in the application by avoiding inappropriate comparisons.
