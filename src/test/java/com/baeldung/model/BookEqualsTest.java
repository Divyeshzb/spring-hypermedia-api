================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Incorrect Equality Check
Issue: Checking if the ‘objects are identical’ instead of ‘having identical properties’ can lead to bugs and loop holes in business logic. This can potentially be exploited by attackers.
Solution: Instead of checking ‘getClass() != obj.getClass()’, check if ‘instanceof’ can be used. Instanceof will not violate the symmetry requirement of the equals() contract.

Vulnerability: Null Pointer Exception
Issue: Checking equality with properties of an object without null safe check can cause null pointer exception making your application crash or misbehave.
Solution: Ensure all property checks are null safe. Utilize Java 8’s Objects class for null safe comparison. Alternatively, use libraries such as Apache Commons Lang for null-safe comparison.

Vulnerability: Information leakage due to bad casting
Issue: Unsafe casting can lead to ClassCastException. If not properly caught, this may reveal information about the object’s actual class.
Solution: Check whether the Object can be casted to the expected class before doing so. This can be done with the 'instanceof' operator.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent equals and hashCode
Issue: If hashCode() is not consistent with equals(), this can lead to unexpected behavior in collections. If an attacker can influence the object's hashCode they may be able to cause a denial of service.
Solution: Ensure hashCode() uses the same properties as equals(). Utilize a good implementation strategy to generate hashCodes. Many IDEs can generate these for you or you can use libraries such as Apache Commons Lang.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing Equals Method with Same Object Reference
Details:
    TestName: testEqualsWithSameObjectReference
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies and returns true when the object reference passed to it is the same as the object invoking the method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Book object with certain properties.
    Act: Call the equals method using the same book object as the parameter.
    Assert: The result should be true.
  Validation:
    The equals method should return true when the same object is passed as a parameter because the reference is the same. This is important to make sure the equals method works as expected according to the Java contract.

Scenario 2: Testing Equals Method with Null Object
Details:
    TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies and returns false when null is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Book object with certain properties.
    Act: Call equals method with null parameter.
    Assert: The result should be false.
  Validation:
    The equals method should return false when a null object is passed, according to the Java equals method contract. This ensures the method behaves correctly when dealing with null pointers.

Scenario 3: Testing Equals Method with Different Class Object
Details:
    TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies and returns false when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Book object and a String object.
    Act: Call equals method of the Book object with the String object.
    Assert: The result should be false.
  Validation:
    The equals method should identify that objects of different classes aren't equal, regardless of the actual content of the objects. This behaviour is essential to comply with Java's contract for the equals method.

Scenario 4: Testing Equals Method with Identical Book Objects
Details:
    TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalBookObjects
    Description: This test verifies that the equals method can correctly identify when two different Book objects have the same properties (author, title and isbn).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different Book objects with the same properties.
    Act: Use equals method to compare the two Book objects
    Assert: The result should be true.
  Validation:
    The equals method should be able to accurately compare the properties of two Book objects and return true if they are identical. This ensures that logical equality is properly identified and ensures valid outcomes in operations that depend on object equality.

Scenario 5: Testing Equals Method with Different Book Objects
Details:
    TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentBookObjects
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies and returns false when the Book objects being compared are not identical.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different Book objects with different properties.
    Act: Call equals method of one Book object with the other Book object as parameter.
    Assert: The result should be false.
  Validation:
    The equals method should return false when the Book objects being compared have different properties. This ensures that it can accurately detect when two objects are not the same."""
