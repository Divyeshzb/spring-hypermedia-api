================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The equals method does not have any check for the type of object passed to it, this may result in a ClassCastException when an unexpected type is passed. This could allow an attacker to introduce unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Ensure that the parameter provided in the equals method matches the expected type. Implement type checking before performing the typecast.

Vulnerability: Incomplete Exception Handling (CWE-390)
Issue: In case of any unexpected behavior or failure, no exception is thrown or logged. This may conceal abnormal behavior making it difficult for developers to debug in case of an error or a possible security vulnerability being exploited.
Solution: Implement proper exception handling and logging so that any irregularities can be recorded and analyzed during the debugging and auditing process.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Exact Same Object Comparison
    Details:
        TestName: equalsWithSameObject.
        Description: Test is meant to check if the equals method returns true when comparing a book object to itself. 
    Execution:
        Arrange: Create a single Book object.
        Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the same Book object as the parameter. 
        Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
    Validation: 
        The assertion aims to verify that a book object is equal to itself. It ensures the equals method behaves as expected in case of self-comparison.

Scenario 2: Test for Different Object Comparison.
    Details:
        TestName: equalsWithDifferentObjects.
        Description: Test is intended to validate the scenario that equals returns false when comparing two objects that are not similar.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Create two different Book objects, with different titles, author names and ISBN.
        Act: Invoke equals method on one of the Book objects, pass the other as parameter.
        Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
    Validation:
        The test validates that the equals method correctly identifies two dissimilar Book objects. It upholds the business logic by confirming objects with diverse properties are not treated as identical.

Scenario 3: Test for Null Object Comparison.
    Details:
        TestName: equalsWithNullObject.
        Description: Test is intended to validate equals method when it's passed a null object.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Create a Book object.
        Act: Invoke equals method on the Book object, passing null as parameter.
        Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
    Validation:
        The test verifies equals method correctly handles null inputs. Returning false when a null object is passed is consistent with Java's general contract for object comparison.

Scenario 4: Test for Objects of Different Classes.
    Details:
        TestName: equalsWithDifferentClassObject.
        Description: Test is meant to check if equals method returns false when comparing a book object to a non-book object.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Create a Book object and a String object.
        Act: Invoke equals method on the Book object, passing the String object as parameter.
        Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
    Validation: 
        The assertion aims to verify the equals method can handle objects of different classes. The expected outcome is a testament to the method's solid error handling in wrongly typed inputs.

Scenario 5: Test for Book objects with Identical Attributes.
    Details:
        TestName: equalsWithIdenticalAttributes.
        Description: Test is intended to validate if equals method returns true when comparing two book objects with the same title, author and ISBN.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Create two book objects with the same title, author and ISBN.
        Act: Invoke equals method on one of the book objects, pass the other as parameter.
        Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
    Validation: 
        The test verifies the equals method correctly identifies two similar Book objects. It ensures the business logic stands by treating objects with similar properties as equal.
