================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: There is no explicit sanitization of the SQL queries, this may lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. If an attacker gains the ability to inject SQL commands, they can manipulate, delete, or reveal sensitive data.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, provided by Java's PreparedStatement, to ensure all user input is properly sanitized. This protects against potential SQL injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: If any outbound connections to databases, APIs or other services require authentication, ensure that the application doesn't use hard-coded credentials. Hard-coded credentials can become a significant security vulnerability if the codebase is leaked or shared.
Solution: Use secure methods for handling credentials. This could be through environmental variables, a secure configuration file that is not shared or uploaded, or a secured, centralized service like a vault system.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The findAll() method might be exposed as a public API endpoint without proper authentication and authorization, which could let unauthenticated users fetch all book records.
Solution: Add authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive API endpoints. Use a standard authentication system such as OAuth2 or JWT. Ensure that only users with suitable privileges can access sensitive data.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if "findAll" method returns list of book resources.
Details:  
  TestName: testFindAllReturnsBookResources.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the "findAll" method returns a list of book resources as expected. The target scenario is the nominal case where the database contains several books.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the "repo.findAll()" method to return a list of book objects. 
    Act: Call "findAll()" method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned list matches the expected list of book resources.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the "findAll" method correctly converts book objects into book resources and returns them as a list. This test is significant as it confirms that the "findAll" method operates as expected in normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Test to check if "findAll" method handles empty database scenario.
Details:  
  TestName: testFindAllHandlesEmptyDatabase.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the "findAll" method handles the scenario when the database does not contain any book records. The target scenario is an edge case where the book database is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the "repo.findAll()" method to return an empty list.
    Act: Call "findAll()" method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned list is empty.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the "findAll" method correctly handles the scenario when there are no book records in the database and returns an empty list. This test is significant as it confirms that the "findAll" method operates as expected in edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test to check if "findAll" method handles a null database scenario.
Details:  
  TestName: testFindAllHandlesNullDatabase.
  Description: This test is verifying if the "findAll()" method correctly handles a null database scenario. The target scenario is when the database has no records.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the "repo.findAll()" method to return null. 
    Act: Call "findAll()" method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify if the "findAll" method throws a NullPointerException when "repo.findAll()" is null. It ensures that the method effectively handles a null return scenario from the repository layer.
