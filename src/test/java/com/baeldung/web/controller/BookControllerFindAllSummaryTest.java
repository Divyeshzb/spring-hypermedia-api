================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The findAll() method directly communicates with the database without sanitizing user inputs, potentially creating an opportunity for SQL Injection, which can lead to leaking of sensitive data and unintended modifications in the database.
Solution: To mitigate against SQL Injection, avoid building database queries using string concatenation with unsanitized inputs. Instead, use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which can automatically sanitize user inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
Issue: In a case where your application interacts with secured endpoints, improper validation of certificates can lead to severe security vulnerabilities. An attacker may trick the application into communicating with a malicious server, leading to potential data leakage.
Solution: Always validate certificates properly. Double-check that the certificate belongs to the correct party. In Java, use HTTP's URL's openConnection(), getServerCertificates(), and check that the hostname in the certificate is what you expect.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If your API responses are consumed by a browser-based application and inputs are not properly sanitized or output encoded, it may lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Attackers can inject malicious scripts through input fields, leading to session hijacking or defacement of the website.
Solution: Escape necessary characters in your output and sanitize inputs. If you use libraries for generating HTML, ensure they automatically encode output. Adopt a policy of least privilege, giving permissions to only those who need them.

"""
Scenario 1: Normal Functioning of findAllSummary

Details:  
  TestName: testFindAllSummary
  Description: This test is meant to check if the findAllSummary method works as expected when the repository contains multiple books. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to return a specific list of Books when findAll() method is invoked.
  Act: Invoke the findAllSummary method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual bookResources returned against the expected bookResources list.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the returned list of bookResources matches the expected list. It's crucial as it ensures the proper transformation from Book to BookResource and basic retrieval functionality of the findAllSummary method.

Scenario 2: No Books in Repository 

Details:  
  TestName: testFindAllSummaryNoBooks
  Description: This test is meant to check how the findAllSummary method behaves when the repository does not contain any books. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to return an empty list when findAll() method is invoked.
  Act: Invoke the findAllSummary() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to assert that the returned list of bookResources is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that an empty list is returned when there are no books in the repository. This is crucial as it tests the findAllSummary method's ability to handle situations where no books are available.

Scenario 3: Null Repository

Details:  
  TestName: testFindAllSummaryNullRepo
  Description: This test aims to check how the findAllSummary method behaves when the repository itself is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the BookRepository to null.
  Act: Invoke the findAllSummary method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to catch the NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The test verifies that the method throws a NullPointerException when the repository is null. It's important as it checks how the findAllSummary method handles improper or missing repository instances.
  
Scenario 4: Exception Thrown by Repository 

Details:  
  TestName: testFindAllSummaryExceptionInRepo
  Description: This test is meant to check how the findAllSummary method behaves when the BookRepository throws exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to throw a specific exception when findAll() method is invoked.
  Act: Invoke the findAllSummary() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to catch the thrown exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the findAllSummary method properly catches and handles any exceptions thrown by the repository. This is significant as it confirms the robustness of the findAllSummary method against potential failures in underlying layers.
