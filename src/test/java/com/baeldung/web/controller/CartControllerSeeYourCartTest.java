================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection
Issue: The application may inadvertently redirect users to malicious websites because the code does not validate URLs. This can happen during navigation by end-users or other sensitive actions.
Solution: Always validate URLs to ensure they are within the intended domain and do not expose users to unwanted redirects or phishing attempts.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The application might be prone to CSRF attacks because the server does not appear to include CSRF tokens in its responses. An attacker can trick an end-user into performing unwanted actions on a web application.
Solution: Implement CSRF protections, such as including unique and unguessable CSRF tokens in every HTTP response. It can be achieved using Spring's CSRF Protection.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The disclosed code exhibits inadequate separation of concerns, potentially leading to the inappropriate exposure of private information.
Solution: Refactor the code to separate concerns more effectively and ensure private information is securely handled, making use of Java's inherent support for Object-Oriented Programming.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in URL
Issue: The application appears to be generating URLs that contain sensitive information within the query string, making it vulnerable to exposure if the URLs are logged in clear text by any intermediary systems.
Solution: Refrain from using sensitive information as part of the query strings. Instead, encode the information into POST data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Response Test

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnValidCartResourceWhenSeeYourCartIsCalled
  Description: This test is designed to validate the seeYourCart method in an ideal scenario in which it should return a valid CartResource without throwing any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is needed for this test as there are no input parameters.
  Act: Invoke the seeYourCart method.
  Assert: Using JUnit assertions, confirm if the returned object is an instance of CartResource.
Validation: 
  The assertion is verifying that a valid CartResource object is returned as expected. This verifies that the seeYourCart method is working as per the design under normal operating conditions.


Scenario 2: Null Response Test 

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnNullWhenThereIsNoCartToSee
  Description: This scenario is to test if the seeYourCart method returns null when there is no cart to retrieve.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the class dependencies to setup a scenario where no cart is available.
  Act: Call the seeYourCart method.
  Assert: Using JUnit assertions, confirm if the returned object is Null.
Validation: 
  This test is crucial for ensuring the applicationâ€™s robustness by confirming it handles the absence of a cart without failing or producing undesired results.


Scenario 3: Exception Handling Test 

Details:
  TestName: shouldHandleExceptionsWhenErrorOccursInSeeYourCart
  Description: This scenario is to test if seeYourCart handles exceptions correctly when an error occurs while trying to retrieve the cart.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the dependencies to generate an exception when seeYourCart method is called.
  Act: Invoke the seeYourCart method.
  Assert: Using JUnit assertions, check if the appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This validation is necessary from a robustness standpoint, as the application should be able to handle any exceptions or errors that it might encounter while trying to retrieve the cart.
